Below are collections of photos that I've taken -- some are meant to be just pretty, others depict places that I've seen and things that I've done.
All of them had been compressed (quite agressively) to be web-usable; **if you'd like to see the originals, simply click on the photos.**

As a rule of thumb, those from trips will be displayed essentially the way they were taken (only with minor modifications like denoising/exposure), whereas those in categories will be more heavily edited.

The number [\(x\)] next to the categories is the total number of the photos in the collection.

_All of the photos are licensed under **[CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)**, so kindly respect it if you plan on using any of them for uses other than personal._
