2
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:11,816
Good day.

3
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:19,983
Sorry.

4
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:29,833
I would like... I'd like...

5
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,716
Brother, what are you mumbling about?

6
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,366
Brother?

7
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:36,566
Where were you?

8
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,400
At the pub.

9
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,800
I was waiting for them to open.

10
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:41,100
Couldn't you buy the morning beer in a bottle?

11
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,433
I was waiting for them to open to let me out.

12
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:44,550
What were you doing?

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,283
Not sure, exactly.

14
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,916
Why is God punishing me?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,700
Why, Why?

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,716
Where are you going?

17
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:53,483
Somewhere to hide.

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't know where.

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,333
Could you leave me here, bro?

20
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:01,100
I would scoot somewhere and...

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,283
You'll scoot right behind the counter and work until you black out.

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,466
You don't have a heart.

23
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,450
I didn't stop all night, I don't even know who I am.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,450
You are my brother, your name is Ozzák, I employ you, and you got to work four hours late.

25
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,433
I thought this place looked familiar.

26
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,050
Removes even the most stubborn stains.

27
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:08,216
Coffee, tea, chocolate, blood, grass, raspberries, butterfat, red wine, fuel oil.

28
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,416
It seems that Ozzák came up with something more resilient.

29
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,366
Iva, are you done?

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,533
The hit-charade is really glossy from over here.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,733
No, dad.

32
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:22,083
Nobody is sitting here until it's dry.

33
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:24,366
Couldn't something be done?

34
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,016
Yes.

35
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,416
Buy a new one.

36
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:29,150
I thought about using a hairdryer or something.

37
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:34,433
You also don't have to watch every pop fossil.

38
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:36,216
I hope you're not referring to me.

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,750
No, thankfully your songs have long been forgotten.

40
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:45,333
You'd be surprised. Píšová from the fourth floor was whistling "Vsákneš se do mě jako déšť."

41
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,950
She even has me in her collection of old records.

42
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:49,533
She's interested.

43
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,183
Iva, she is sixty-five years old.

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Same as this sofa.

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,566
Do you know how much dust it accumulated over the years?

46
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,650
You always say that when you're cleaning it.

47
00:02:58,683 --> 00:02:59,783
Today is the last time I'm saying it.

48
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,350
Seriously?

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,250
Because I'm cleaning her for the last time.

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,416
It will not be here tomorrow.

51
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,050
Wait, but Ivuško, you know our financials.

52
00:03:09,116 --> 00:03:11,050
CDs are not selling much these days.

53
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,283
And are you surprised?

54
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:13,800
We don't have customers.

55
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,333
Whoever strays to us by chance, Ozzák deals with.

56
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:18,533
I will have to talk to him about that.

57
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,083
This morning, he didn't even know his name.

58
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:22,283
Well.

59
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,433
Simona said she fell asleep under the ju-box.

60
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:27,816
And when she was mopping, she mixed him up with an old bundle of rags, so he stayed there.

61
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,350
What about the sofa?

62
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:36,050
Okay, fine, if we find something that is affordable...

63
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,616
Well then, go on.

64
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:40,583
A new furniture store.

65
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,650
The only way to get it cheaper is the landfill.

66
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:50,933
It's still beyond our options...

67
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:54,300
Hey, a social program.

68
00:03:55,016 --> 00:04:01,966
Our special series emphasize low prices while using only slightly toxic materials.

69
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:07,033
Produced in countries of the third world, with child labor constituting at most five percent.

70
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,283
Good day, Mr. Pacovský.

71
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:17,399
Do you know whether the new Eva Farna's out yet?

72
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,000
Moment, Lexa, you know the rules.

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,833
Come on, Mr. Pacovsky, have mercy.

74
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,000
I've had a bad day.

75
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,616
So am I, but the rules are the rules.

76
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:27,783
Music is like a gun, they won't give it to anyone.

77
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,733
They do at Bontonland.

78
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:34,100
No wonder that they're going downhill.

79
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,433
First,

80
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,366
show me how to threaten.

81
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:40,733
Lexa?!

82
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,316
You scared off my sister.

83
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,100
You have a sister?

84
00:04:58,116 --> 00:04:59,416
Bring her over sometime.

85
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,316
I bring her constantly, but you never notice.

86
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:04,200
Well, I had a tough night, she must have slipped my mind.

87
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:05,783
She's pretty quiet.

88
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:08,833
Our head teacher introduced her as a new student three times this year.

89
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,333
Yeah.

90
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,400
Anyway, who were we talking about?

91
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,350
Doesn't matter.

92
00:05:13,383 --> 00:05:14,383
Second.

93
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,616
Mr. Pacovský, just tell me if the new Eva Farna was released.

94
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,133
Quiet!

95
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,883
Second.

96
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,350
How many members did Led Zeppelin have in their original lineup?

97
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,100
Why do I have to know all this?

98
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,600
So that you become a man.

99
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:28,633
And what about Eva Farna?

100
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,033
She won't become a man.

101
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,900
Is it out yet?

102
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,216
It is, why?

103
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,450
Awesome, thanks!

104
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,283
I'll go download it.

105
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,316
Download.

106
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,733
A cruel punishment.

107
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:44,683
Considering her music, it's probably deserved.

108
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:49,583
I'm telling you, it seems small.

109
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,233
It's just right.

110
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,516
You've seen me measure it several times.

111
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,300
Exactly.

112
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,383
Ozzák, why are you not in the shop?

113
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,900
Afternoon break.

114
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,550
It's 4:30 PM.

115
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,733
Nevermind, step aside, we're assembling the new sofa.

116
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,133
Wait!

117
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:09,350
There used to be a sofa here.

118
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:11,383
I had a dent in it.

119
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:11,916
Where is it?

120
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,216
We're not telling you, you'd bring it back.

121
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,300
Brother, I stored many important things in it.

122
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:21,116
For example, that shirt I had on in Budapest when Mercury patted me on the back.

123
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:24,266
I took all of those out and put the washed shirt in the cupboard.

124
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,633
What?

125
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:26,416
What?

126
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:27,600
You washed it?

127
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,216
Iva, for God's sake.

128
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,933
One day, that shirt was to be an endowment.

129
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:33,283
It won't have any value washed.

130
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,216
It will be enough knowing it's yours.

131
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,300
Wait, wait.

132
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,783
Wait.

133
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:41,250
There was one more really important thing.

134
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:43,600
Damn it, I can't remember.

135
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,700
What a bad day.

136
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:48,816
Give it time, brother, you didn't even remember your name this morning.

137
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,550
Ozzák.

138
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:52,016
Anyway.

139
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,616
Where did you get this?

140
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,200
In the new Finnish shop.

141
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,750
They have lots of pretty things there.

142
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,483
And also a few cheap ones.

143
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:01,933
Ugly ones.

144
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,283
You wanted this one.

145
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,583
No, I wanted a larger one.

146
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,150
No, Ferivachtivachta was the bigger one and it was too expensive.

147
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,433
Yeah, but it was beautiful.

148
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:12,233
Considering the price, this sofa is gorgeous.

149
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,766
At least it's washable.

150
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:17,750
I think it's alright.

151
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:27,283
Ivuška?

152
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,333
What does imbus mean in Finnish?

153
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:35,333
There must be a dictionary here somewhere.

154
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,366
Ouch!

155
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,116
Paper cut.

156
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:39,733
Jesus Christ, give it.

157
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:42,800
Good day!

158
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,900
My mom is sending Saša to thank you for the sofa.

159
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,550
Wouldn't it be enough for just Saša to come?

160
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,233
Saša is shy.

161
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,066
Wow!

162
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:52,850
Is this the new futon?

163
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,066
Could I help you to assemble it?

164
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:54,616
No.

165
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,983
Well, if you want.

166
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:59,050
Good day, Mr. Pacovský, my mom sent me.

167
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,783
Thank you for the sofa.

168
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,466
And?

169
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,450
That's it.

170
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,300
Yes, well, it might be older but it's still functional.

171
00:08:10,383 --> 00:08:11,583
Great.

172
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,150
One more over there.

173
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:16,083
Here, here also.

174
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:16,816
Here.

175
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,033
Ouch!

176
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:20,600
Ow!

177
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,633
Damn, back pain.

178
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:27,000
And I have to go to the store anyway, so, see you for now.

179
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,550
I think you kids will do great.

180
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,550
I'm making Lexa the leader, I'm going.

181
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:33,900
Ouch, ow, my back, my back.

182
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,283
What's happening here?

183
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:45,033
Him!

184
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:45,416
What?

185
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:45,966
Snitch!

186
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:53,300
Ozzák, what is the meaning of this?

187
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,266
He wanted Zagorová.

188
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,483
And why was he crying?

189
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,633
I played him some Metallica to change his mind.

190
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:00,516
Ozzáku, this has to stop.

191
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:03,466
You will be selling people what they want.

192
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:06,966
For God's sake, where is the cash register?

193
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:09,800
Well you said that I should sell people what they want, right?

194
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,966
A guy came by and said that he really likes it.

195
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:12,900
So I sold it to him.

196
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,216
It was a great deal.

197
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:16,083
It had five hundred in it and he gave me a thousand.

198
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:25,366
I should have asked for more, huh?

199
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:28,250
Brother, you're acting like a lunatic.

200
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:30,650
Why did you get so hammered at the pub yesterday?

201
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,366
Because your song was playing the whole evening.

202
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,666
Jako déšť?

203
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,383
From the radio?

204
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:36,400
From the Ju-box.

205
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,966
Some hag put in five hundred and it looped the entire evening.

206
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:42,616
She's at fault.

207
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,616
I had to get through it somehow.

208
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:46,400
Excuse me?

209
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,300
I would like to remind you that that song got us this shop.

210
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,100
A music store?

211
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,016
Brother, you can't buy music.

212
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,283
Yes, not here, with your attitude we should just close.

213
00:09:57,683 --> 00:09:58,450
Really?

214
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,383
That would really come in handy.

215
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,750
I'm parched, you know.

216
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,266
No pub.

217
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:05,666
You always say that when you run out of arguments.

218
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:13,683
What are you doing, Lexa?

219
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,283
Assembling the sofa.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,583
Move.

221
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,433
That's also an option.

222
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,500
You know what, Lexa?

223
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:32,733
Go sit down, this is a work for a man or a woman.

224
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,133
You're too stupid for a woman and too young for a man.

225
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:39,083
I'm three minutes older than my sister.

226
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,733
Lexa, boys grow up slower than girls.

227
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,083
It's not about speed, but about quality.

228
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,950
Unfortunately, neither worked in your case.

229
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,633
For your information, I have pubes.

230
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,083
You'll soak into to me like rain and I'll soak to you,

231
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,250
you won't find such happiness.

232
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,450
Even if you went all the way to heaven,

233
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,800
until you carry me off like a hurricane.

234
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,016
Simona, you're playing my songs when you're alone?

235
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:18,366
No, it's still going from yesterday.

236
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:21,133
A woman pre-ordered it a hundred times.

237
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,250
Ah yeah, Ozzák said something about a fan.

238
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,266
No, this is unbearable.

239
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,216
You sound just like Ozzák.

240
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:34,733
Ozzák has a deeper voice, a mustache, and owes me three hundred.

241
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:36,716
I will pay.

242
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:38,883
Leave it, that's for the sofa.

243
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:42,150
Listen, did your ex really take everything?

244
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:44,883
No, only what could be sold.

245
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,150
He left Lexa, Saša and the built-in wardrobes.

246
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,966
Good day, Mr. Pacovsky.

247
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:50,533
Hello.

248
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:51,216
Hi, mom.

249
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:52,433
Hey.

250
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,016
Mom, I need advice.

251
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:54,883
So do I.

252
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,883
What's up?

253
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,033
Mom, do you think I'm a man?

254
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:02,000
You have pubes.

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
Then it's simple.

256
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,766
Pick up a girl,

257
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,983
have two kids, then move in with some floozy with all the furniture.

258
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:13,950
I have the problem even picking up a girl.

259
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,750
Don't look at me, I haven't seen a girl in ages.

260
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,316
Right, Simona?

261
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,916
So, Lexa, being a man is tough.

262
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,716
Right, that's why I brought a book.

263
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:30,450
Mistake number one.

264
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,566
A man never reads.

265
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,300
But this is a Handbook for the modern man.

266
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,266
That doesn't mean you have to read all of it.

267
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,266
Ozzák and the table of contents are enough.

268
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:42,266
Greet me.

269
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,283
Good day.

270
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:46,883
Jesus Christ Lexa.

271
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:47,466
Try this.

272
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,416
Good, that's more like it.

273
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,516
Moving on.

274
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:58,333
Dining.

275
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,150
I'll teach you to eat beer.

276
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:01,833
But my mom forbade that.

277
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,900
Excellent.

278
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,866
Ozzák's rule number one:

279
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,850
A man always listens to his mother.

280
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:11,266
Moving on.

281
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:13,050
Behavior towards the female sex.

282
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:16,083
You're too young for that.

283
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,100
Let's start with behavior toward females in general.

284
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,433
Opening doors.

285
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,966
That's clear.

286
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,650
If you don't open it, they won't leave.

287
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,300
Hygiene.

288
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,983
I don't know what that is.

289
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:29,266
Probably some foul disease.

290
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,366
And that's it?

291
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:31,350
No!

292
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,283
Now comes the most important part.

293
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,900
Lexa,

294
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:44,016
what music do men listen to?

295
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:46,333
Hey, Eva Farna!

296
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:50,566
Black Sabbath?

297
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:51,716
Yes!

298
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:52,866
Excellent!

299
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,566
You can call me Ozzák from now on!

300
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:59,466
Mr. Ozzák, am I a man now?

301
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,550
A man doesn't ask.

302
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,716
A man knows.

303
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:19,716
I said it would be too small.

304
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,950
At least we'll be closer to one another.

305
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,966
You're sitting next to Ozzák.

306
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,500
Hey, brother.

307
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:30,966
Come on, relax.

308
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,750
I want the old one back.

309
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,533
Considering the price, I like it.

310
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:46,116
But I liked the old one.

311
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,783
This one is like

312
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:50,216
Abba.

313
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:53,033
But nobody cares about my opinion in this family.

314
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:55,283
I work like a dog the whole day...

315
00:14:55,283 --> 00:14:57,500
Right, you worked for a grand total of two hours.

316
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,933
And when I get home, I don't even have a place to sit.

317
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,883
Okay, I'll move.

318
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,783
All right, okay.

319
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,200
It's your fault.

320
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:30,000
If you didn't scare off customers, we'd have a beautiful yellow Ferivachtivachta.

321
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,783
Who cares about your vachta?

322
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:33,183
I want my dent.

323
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:34,400
Where even is the old sofa?

324
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,366
With good people.

325
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:36,550
Perhaps they could give it back.

326
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,516
We'll trade it for this one.

327
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,033
No way.

328
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:39,700
Ivuška?

329
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't you remember how we played on it together?

330
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:44,283
How you were constantly jumping on it?

331
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,383
I only remember jumping around it with the vacuum cleaner.

332
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,150
Brother, things change.

333
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:51,466
But why always for the worse?

334
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:53,066
Why did Brychta have to leave Arakajn?

335
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:55,133
Why did you leave the Cuttlefish?

336
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,366
What's Cuttlefish?

337
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,950
The band that could have changed everything.

338
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,683
The Cuttlefish was Ozzák with a drumset.

339
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:02,250
Why?

340
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:07,533
Because I was exploited, betrayed and discarded by my own singer.

341
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,700
Don't listen to him, the singer had a good reason to leave.

342
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,533
Money.

343
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:18,416
Jesus Christ brother, it didn't go anywhere, no concerts, we always played in the basement and the old Přiklopil used to call the cops on us every 30 minutes.

344
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:21,383
Brácha, you don't even remember. It was a revolution.

345
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,316
Songs like Denaturát.

346
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,250
And the ungodly single-cymbal solo.

347
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,300
He sold the rest for booze.

348
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,416
And the chorus, brother...

349
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,583
You had it in you.

350
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,466
Denaturáááááát......

351
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,800
Wow, dad, I didn't know you sang something besides disco.

352
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,950
He used to.

353
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,733
But only after, when he sold out.

354
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:45,916
Because I had enough, I wanted to live a normal life.

355
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:47,083
A normal life?

356
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,416
Is this is a normal life?

357
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,683
Brother, I really feel like a guest here.

358
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,233
You came here sixteen years ago just for a week until you find something.

359
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:56,283
I came to help you.

360
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,800
With what?

361
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:57,933
With the upbringing of our daughter Iva.

362
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:58,433
Our?

363
00:16:58,466 --> 00:16:59,450
Iva is my daughter.

364
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,416
But who took care of her?

365
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:02,833
Who taught her to go?

366
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:03,333
Me.

367
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:04,366
To concerts?

368
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:07,233
She was the youngest Rockfest participant in 1993.

369
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,633
You took her to Rockfest at age one?

370
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:10,783
She only drank draught.

371
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,633
And what do I have to show for it?

372
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:18,733
I changed her dipers, it took me four years to learn.

373
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,066
I used to read her fairy tales, make toys, and even taught her how to read.

374
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:25,349
A is for Alcohol, B is for Brutus, C is for Citrón.

375
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,250
I also took her to first grade.

376
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,500
But in October.

377
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,416
And where did I end up?

378
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,600
On the floor.

379
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:35,266
Okay, go look for, I don't know, an armchair.

380
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:36,316
And with what?

381
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,216
What do you mean with what?

382
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,333
Figure it out, I don't know, find something for free.

383
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:53,833
D is for Debustrol, E is for Echti, F is for, for, for...

384
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,466
Fernet...

385
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:57,300
Fernet! F is for fernet,

386
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:22,750
Did you see that, Mr. Ozzák?

387
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:23,666
What?

388
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,183
Well your music works.

389
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,700
I've barely started playing it and girls are already banging on my door.

390
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:29,350
That's normal.

391
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,433
What are you doing?

392
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,150
Looking for an armchair.

393
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:33,933
Armchair?

394
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:36,800
A man probably needs one, right?

395
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,583
You know it.

396
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,766
We only have an old and ugly sofa.

397
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,866
Don't need that, need an armchair.

398
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,100
What will it be like?

399
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:44,950
Black.

400
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:45,983
Black and dangerous.

401
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,050
Where can something like that be found?

402
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:50,450
Metloš knows.

403
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,883
Metloš.

404
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,450
That's a man's name.

405
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:56,766
My friend, it's the toughest guy in this entire country.

406
00:18:56,766 --> 00:19:00,083
And the armchair I'm talking about hasn't been sat in since 2002.

407
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,266
What happened?

408
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,683
Brichta left Arakain.

409
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:10,350
When they released "Trash the Trash," Metloš made a throne for Brichta, the metal king.

410
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,533
But the armchair later rejected Aleš.

411
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:13,200
Why?

412
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,600
He released "Tenhle barák na vodstřel."

413
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:16,500
The armchair bit him.

414
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,866
It bit through his leather pants and gave him rabies.

415
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,500
Wow, that's a really manly piece of furniture.

416
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:27,250
Look, here it is, Metloš's contact information.

417
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,500
Daily at The Sparrows', Thursdays at The Tiger.

418
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:35,016
And Mr. Ozzák, can I be a man even without an armchair?

419
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:36,650
Lexo, again?!

420
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,033
Damn.

421
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,483
Ouch!

422
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,900
It bit me.

423
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,700
Nonsense.

424
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:54,766
It's just an armchair.

425
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,900
Or something related.

426
00:19:58,916 --> 00:19:59,933
Huh!

427
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,133
What in God's name is this?

428
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,533
Ozzák found an armchair.

429
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:07,850
Just as you said.

430
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,516
It looks like a member of the gestapo.

431
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,683
He could have brought something worse.

432
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,033
It's looking at me.

433
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,816
We won't be able to invite anyone over.

434
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,566
Besides Eva Brown.

435
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,716
Morning!

436
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,066
Wow!

437
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,533
Respect, Metloš!

438
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,600
Where is Mr. Ozzák?

439
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:29,300
What do you want?

440
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:30,316
I'd like to ask him about something.

441
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:31,216
No!

442
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:32,966
Nevermind.

443
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,900
Can I try it out?

444
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,383
Be careful, it bites!

445
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,566
Go ahead, you've got about a minute.

446
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,466
Before Mr. Ozzák gets here?

447
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,633
Before that thing leaves the house.

448
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,416
It actually bit me.

449
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:46,516
I told you.

450
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,650
Don't be stupid, it's just a chair.

451
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,450
Did it burn through my pants?

452
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,933
What if it has rabies?

453
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:56,016
Oh wow, damn, that's a man's place.

454
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,700
Wait, wait, wait, Lexa.

455
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:58,983
It's not your time yet.

456
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,483
Ozzák, that thing is leaving.

457
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,683
So I can't even bring anything into our house?

458
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:06,766
This is my house.

459
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:08,333
You always say that when you run out of arguments.

460
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:16,766
He told him to get an armchair.

461
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:18,250
An armchair, not a Nosferatu vampire!

462
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,750
This doesn't fit in here at all!

463
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,866
Brother, this chair was looking for me my whole life.

464
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:23,650
My whole life.

465
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,466
Out.

466
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:26,733
You wouldn't throw out such a valuable piece of furniture, would you?

467
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:29,600
Do you mean to say that that atrocity cost something?

468
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
Brother, its value can't be measured in money.

469
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:33,550
In what then?

470
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,366
Metloš calculated it in CDs.

471
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,283
In what CDs?

472
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,500
In the vast majority of CDs in the shop.

473
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,466
Out!

474
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:11,416
He had a bad day.

475
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:14,266
He's been having had a bad day for the last sixteen years.

476
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,833
Ivo, this has to stop.

477
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:17,083
What do you want to do about it?

478
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,766
Dad?

479
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,216
You're not serious.

480
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:27,433
Ivo, I like Ozzák, but look where we are.

481
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,600
A shop without CDs, an empty bank account.

482
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,433
Mr. Ozzák, Saša found something that probably belongs to you.

483
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:38,583
Where is Mr. Ozzák?

484
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,583
Where is the armchair?

485
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,200
Show me, give it here.

486
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,600
Hey, old records, we could sell that.

487
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:44,616
Never.

488
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,900
This is important.

489
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:52,183
Uncle,

490
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,783
look what Sara found in the sofa.

491
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,900
How could I have forgotten?

492
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,950
Well I remembered immediately, this is the fairy tale you made me.

493
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:02,933
Alright, come on.

494
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:14,950
A tale about prince Debustrol and the valiant Kiss

495
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,733
went to slay a dragon.

496
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:19,766
A ghost.

497
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:23,966
Right, they went to slay a ghost, only with a red hat.

498
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:26,283
I bet you don't remember how it ended.

499
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:36,616
Brave Debustrol rescued Lady Jane and they lived happily ever after at the Hotel California.

500
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,166
Then the bell rang and the fairy tale was done.

501
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,950
Uncle, you're crazy.

502
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,500
And a lullaby.

503
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:25,016
She's asleep!

504
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,150
Where did you get that?

505
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,450
I went to see Píšová and asked her for her records collection.

506
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:40,633
Howver, I had to make the ultimate sacrifice.

507
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,666
Brother?

508
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:45,100
Are you crazy? She's sixty five.

509
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,850
I had to watch the Best Of Ein Kessel Buntes.

510
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:55,500
Wasn't it great when when she was still a kid?

511
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:56,300
Yes, it was.

512
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:59,100
Since then, my hangovers have gotten so much worse.

513
00:24:59,166 --> 00:24:59,866
No doubt.

514
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,450
And what's this?

515
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:02,800
A golden record for "Jako Déšť".

516
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,950
Well I took everything that I could get.

517
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:08,850
This song is the reason, along with the woman who kept playing it at The Badger.

518
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,000
Jesus what's your deal? It's relatively good.

519
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,783
Relatively.

520
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:15,800
Every time I hear it, I'm reminded of our crippled Cuttlefish.

521
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:19,100
Jesus, the Cuttlefish wouldn't have lasted long, you and I are too different.

522
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,783
That's why this shop is called At the Two Chords.

523
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:25,533
I thought it was because yours songs used only two chords.

524
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,900
If I hadn't left the Cuttlefish, I wouldn't have gone to the Děčín Anchor.

525
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:31,383
If I hadn't gone to the Děčín Anchor, I wouldn't have met Kristýna.

526
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,950
And if I didn't know Kristyna, I wouldn't have... We wouldn't have Iva.

527
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,833
Hey... did she really only drink draught when at Rockfest?

528
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:43,000
Who do you think I am?

529
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,166
So who will carry her upstairs?

530
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,550
Listen, I really pulled my back when carrying that sofa...

531
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,383
Jesus Christ, she's 16, I think she can walk on her own.

532
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,100
Ivuška, wake up, we're going home.

533
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,166
Well, we'll go home too.

534
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,300
Let's go.

535
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:13,916
God damn...

536
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:14,683
My back...

537
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,783
Jesus Christ!

538
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:28,066
It fits in much better, right?

539
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,383
Morning.

540
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,200
You?

541
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:45,450
You?

542
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,700
That's the woman that caused it all!

543
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:48,616
Who?

544
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:51,900
The one that was playing my brother's song the whole evening at The Badger!

545
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,166
And you're the lying hobo who said he's the brother of Tomáš Pascovský.

546
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:58,416
Hang on, that's true though.

547
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,050
And this is the shop of the Pacovský brothers.

548
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,950
Can I help you?

549
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,700
Oh.

550
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,016
Yes, you can.

551
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:07,733
I'm afraid we can't.
