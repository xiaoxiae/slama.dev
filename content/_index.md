_**Warning:** I've recently **rewritten the entire website** from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Although I've tried to match the original as closely as possible, some things will look different; if you spot something that broke, please shoot me an email!_


## Hi everyone!

I'm Tom and this is my personal website.

I'm a full-stack developer at **[Freya Voice](https://freyavoice.ai/)**, working on **[Climbuddy](https://climbuddy.com)** in my spare time.

Besides programming, I like to play <a class='secret' href='/assets/nolife.webp'>video games</a>, [take photos](/photos/), [make videos](/videos/) and [rock climb](/climbing/).

This website contains things I feel are interesting enough to put on the internet.
The language is English, but some posts might be written in other languages (and will be denoted as such).
Links to the sections of the website can be found at the top, links to the posts can be found below.
