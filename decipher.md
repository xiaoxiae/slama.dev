I sometimes have ideas about creating fun tasks/ciphers (like the [AOC thing](https://slama.dev/aok) thing I did for my <a class='secret' href='/assets/kacka.webp'>girlfriend</a>), but since I usually don't send these to people, they remain forgoten.
This page serves as a place where I'll be putting them from now on.

If you're solving them and want to check solution, here are their [SHA-256 hashes](/assets/decipher.txt).

<span id='19-2-2024' markdown="1">**19.2.2024:**</span> In preparation for my IGMA exam, here are some random points in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) that definitely have nothing to do with BÃ©zier curves whatsoever (this counts as studying, right?):
- \(P_0 = (0, 0), P_1 = (1, 0), P_2 = (1, 1), P_3 = (0.5, 1)\)
- \(P_0 = (0.5, 1), P_1 = (0, 1), P_2 = (0, 2), P_3 = (1, 2)\)
- \(P_0 = (1.5, 1), P_1 = (1.5, 2.3), P_2 = (2.5, 2.3), P_3 = (2.5, 1)\)
- \(P_0 = (1.5, 0), P_1 = (1.5, 0.5), P_2 = (1.5, 0.5), P_3 = (1.5, 1)\)
- \(P_0 = (2.5, 0), P_1 = (2.5, 0.5), P_2 = (2.5, 0.5), P_3 = (2.5, 1)\)
- \(P_0 = (1.5, 1), P_1 = (2, 1), P_2 = (2, 1), P_3 = (2.5, 1)\)
- \(P_0 = (3, 0), P_1 = (3, 1), P_2 = (3, 1), P_3 = (3, 2)\)
- \(P_0 = (3, 0), P_1 = (4, 0), P_2 = (4, 2), P_3 = (3, 2)\)
