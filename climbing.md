## Journal
The following contains my climbing journal -- how many new/old boulders have I done (and links to them).
It also serves as a convenient way to view the most recently sent boulders (you can also see a list of **[all boulders by color](/climbing/videos/)**).

Since there there are some other walls that I visit from time to time, the journal entries contain clickable icons to their websites.

The format for **bouldering** is <mark class="climbing-diary-record climbing-black climbing-black-text"><strong>old sends/<span class="underline">new sends</span></strong> [<a>video links</a>]</mark>, left-to-right from easy to hard.
Videos marked <mark class="climbing-diary-record climbing-other climbing-other-text"><a>F</a></mark> are flash sends while videos marked <mark class="climbing-diary-record climbing-other climbing-other-text"><a>A</a></mark> are just regular non-flash ascents.

The format for **sport climbing** is <mark class="climbing-diary-record climbing-other climbing-other-text">Name (difficulty, type)</mark>, top-to-bottom from when it was climbed during the given day. The difficulty is in whichever norm the guide is, with the type being either _onsight_ (climb without having seen the route), _redpoint_ (climb with some prior attempts) or _top rope_ (climb with the rope in the anchor).

_Each of the videos are licensed under **[CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)**, so kindly respect it if you plan on using any of them for uses other than personal._
