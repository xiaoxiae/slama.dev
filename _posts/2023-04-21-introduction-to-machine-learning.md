### Resources
- [TensorFlow playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/) -- a really cool visualization of resigning and training a neural network for classification/regression and a number of standard parameters (activation functions, training rates, etc...)


### Introduction

Setting:
- **quantities \(Y\)** that we would like to know but can't easily measure
- **quantities \(X\)** that we can measure and are related to \(Y\)

**Idea:**
- learn a function \(\hat{Y} = f(X)\) such that \(\hat{Y}_i \approx Y_i^*\) (we're close to the real value)

**Traditional approach:**
- ask an expert to figure out \(f(X)\), but for many approaches ML works better

**Machine learning:**
- choose a universal function family \(F\) with parameters \(\theta\)
	- ex. \(F = \left\{ax^2 + b + c\right\}, \theta = \left\{a, b, c\right\}\)
- find parameters \(\hat{\theta}\) that fit the data, so \[\hat{Y} = f_{\hat{\theta}}(X) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \hat{Y}_i \approx Y_i^*\]

**Basic ML workflow:**
1. **collect data** in two datasets: **training** dataset (TS) to train and **test** dataset to validate
	- extremely important, if you don't do this you die instantly
	- necessary for recognizing overfitting (\(F\) is polynomials and we fit points...)
2. **select function family** \(F\)
	- prior knowledge about what the data looks like
	- trial and error (there are tools to help you with this)
3. find the best \(\hat{\theta}\) by fitting \(F\) to the **training** set
4. validate the quality of \(f_{\hat{\theta}}(X)\) on the **test** set
5. **deploy** model in practice

**Probabilistic prediction:**
- reality is often more complicated
- no unique true response \(Y^*\), instead set of possible values (possibly infinite)
- in that case we learn a conditional probability (instead of a function): \[\hat{Y} \sim p(Y \mid X)\]
- to learn this, we define a "universal probability family" with parameters \(\theta\) and chose \(\hat{\theta}\) such that \[Y \sim p_{\hat{\theta}}(Y \mid X)\] matches the data
- strict generalization: deterministic case is recovered by defining \(p(Y \mid X) = \delta(Y - f(X))\)
	- \(\delta\) distribution has only one value
- often we derive deterministic results from probabilistic predictions (eg. mode/median/random sample of the distribution)
	- generally, mode is the best, has some really nice properties

**Problems:**
- nature is not fully predictable
	- _quantum physics_ (randomness)
	- _deterministic chaos_ (pendulum)
	- _combinatorial explosion_ (aminoacids)
- data:
	- finite
	- noisy
	- incomplete
	- ambiguous
- model:
	- function family is imperfect (too small)
	- may not have converged
	- nature has changed in the meantime
- goal:
	- disagreement about what is relevant (desirable)
- **handling uncertainty is central challenge of AI and ML**

### Notation

- **features** vector \(X_i\) for each instance \(i \in 1, \ldots, N\)
- **feature matrix** \(X\) (rows are instances, columns are features \(j \in 1, \ldots, D\))
	- \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}\)

| \(i \setminus j\) | \(1\) (name) | \(2\) (height) | \(3\) (gender) |
| ---               | ---          | ---            | ---            |
| \(1\)             | Alice        | \(1.7\)m       | f              |
| \(2\)             | Bob          | \(1.8\)m       | m              |
| \(3\)             | Max          | \(1.9\)m       | m              |

We usually (when Programming) want a **float matrix:** drop names, discretize labels and use one-hot encoding (one-hot because there is only ones in the particular features).

| \(i \setminus j\) | \(1\) (height) | \(2\) (f) | \(3\) (m) | \(4\) (o) |
| ---               | ---            | ---       | ---       | ---       |
| \(1\)             | \(1.7\)        | \(1\)     | \(0\)     | \(0\)     |
| \(2\)             | \(1.8\)        | \(0\)     | \(1\)     | \(0\)     |
| \(3\)         | \(1.9\)        | \(0\)     | \(1\)     | \(0\)     |

- **response** \(Y_i\) row vector for instance \(i\), response elements \(m \in 1, \ldots, M\)
	- most of the time, \(M = 1\) (scalar response)
	- exception is one-hot encoding of discrete labels
- **tasks** according to type of response
	- \(Y_i \in \mathbb{R}^M \ldots\)  \(Y \approx f_\theta(X)\) is **regression**
	- \(Y_i = k; k \in \left\{1, \ldots, C\right\}\) for \(C\) number of categories \(\ldots\) **classification**
		1. labels are _ordered_ ("tiny" < "small" < "medium" < "large") -- **ordinal classification**
		2. labels are _unordered_ ("apples", "oranges") -- **categorial classification**

- **training set** \(\mathrm{TS} = \left\{(X_i, Y_i)\right\}_{i = 1}^N\) -- **supervised learning**
	- \(Y_i\) is the known response for instance \(i\)

#### Types of learning approaches
1. **supervised learning** -- **true responses** are known in \(\mathrm{TS} = \left\{(X_i, Y_i)\right\}_{i = 1}^N\)
2. **weakly supervised learning**
	1. we have _some_ information (know \(Y_i\) for some instances)
	2. we have _worse_ information (there is a tumor but we don't know where)
3. **unsupervised learning** -- **only features** are known in \(\mathrm{TS} = \left\{X_i\right\}_{i = 1}^N\)
	- learning algorithm must find the structure in the data _on its own_ (data mining or, for humans, "research")
	- only a few solutions that are guaranteed to work (this is unsurprisingly difficult to do)
		1. **representation learning** -- compute new features that are _better to predict_
		2. **clustering** -- group similar instances into "clusters" with a single representative
4. **self-supervised learning** -- define an auxiliary task where \(Y_i\) are easy to determine

### Classification
- \(Y_i = k, k \in \left\{1, \ldots, C\right\}\)
	- common special case \(C = 2\), then \(k \in \left\{0, 1\right\}\) or \(k \in \left\{-1, 1\right\}\)
- **always supervised!**

#### Deterministic classifier
- one hard prediction for each \(i\) \[\hat{Y}_i = f(X_i) \quad \text{with} \quad \hat{Y}_i = Y_i^*\]


**Quality** measured by collecting the "confusion matrix"

| \(\hat{Y} \setminus Y^*\) | \(-1\)         | \(+1\)         |
| ---                       | ---            | ---            |
| \(-1\)                    | true negative  | false negative |
| \(+1\)                    | false positive | true positive  |

1. false positive/negative **fraction** -- "how many out of **all** events are false" \[\frac{\# \mathrm{FP}\ \text{or}\ \# \mathrm{FN}}{\mathrm{N}} \in \left[0, 1\right]\]
2. false positive/negative **rate** -- "how many out of **positive/negative** events are false" \[\frac{\# \mathrm{FP}}{\# \mathrm{FP} + \# \mathrm{TN}} \approx p(\hat{Y} = 1 \mid Y^* = -1) \qquad \frac{\# \mathrm{FN}}{\# \mathrm{FN} + \# \mathrm{TP}} \approx p(\hat{Y} = -1 \mid Y^* = 1)\]

#### Probabilistic classifier
- returns a probabilistic vector \(\in [0, 1]^C\) (soft response) for every label \(\equiv\) posterior distribution \[p(Y = k \mid X)\]
- more general than hard classification -- can recover decision function by returning the most probable label by using \(\arg \max\): \[p(Y = k \mid X) \implies f(X) = \arg \max_k\ p(Y = k \mid X)\]

**Quality** measured by "calibration"
- if \(p(Y = k \mid X) = v\), then label \(k\) should be correct \(v\%\) of the times
	- if actual accuracy is **higher**, then the classifier is "under confident"
	- otherwise it's "over confident" (often happens)

**Important:** calculate confusion matrix or calibration from **test set,** not train set (bias)!

#### Threshold classifier
- single feature \(X \in \mathbb{R}\)
	- usually not enough to predict the response reasonably
- \(\hat{Y} = \mathrm{sign}(X - T) = \begin{cases} 1 & X > T \\ -1 & X < T \end{cases} \quad\) for some threshold \(T\)
- three classical solutions for multiple features
	1. **design a formula** to combine features into single score (use BMI for obese/not obese)
		- hard and expensive for most problems, not to mention inaccurate
	2. **linear classification:** compute score as a linear combination and learn coefficients
		- \(S_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{D} \beta_j X_{ij} \implies \hat{Y}_i = \mathrm{sign}(S_i - T)\) 
		- less powerful than the first one (restricted to linear formulas)
		- we can learn so it usually performs better
	3. **nearest neighbour:** classify test instance \(X_{\text{test}}\) according to most similar training instance
		- \(\hat{i} = \arg \min_i\ \mathrm{dist(X_i, X_{\text{test}})}\)
		- then \(\hat{Y}_{\text{test}} = Y^*_{\hat{i}}\)
		- expensive -- to store the entire training set and scan it for every \(X_{\text{test}}\)
			- doesn't scale well for more features (generalized binary search)
		- hard to define the distance function to reflect true similarity
			- "metric learning" is a hard task of its own...

#### Bayes rule of conditional probability
- joint distribution of features and labels \(p(X, Y)\)
- can be decomposed by the chain rule to
	- \(p(X) p(Y \mid X)\) -- first measure features, then determine response
	- \(p(Y) p(X \mid Y)\) -- first determine response, then get compatible features
- for classification, we want to use **Bayes rule** \[\boxed{\underbrace{p(Y = k \mid X)}_{\text{posterior}} = \frac{  \overbrace{p(X \mid Y = k)}^{\text{likelihood}}\ \overbrace{p(Y = k)}^{\text{prior}} }{\underbrace{p(X)}_{\text{marginal}}}}\]
	- **posterior** -- we want to update our judgement based on measuring the features
	- **prior** -- we know this (1% for a disease in the general population)
	- **likelihood** -- the likelihood of the disease given features (fever, cough)
	- **marginal** -- can be recovered by summing over possibilities: \[p(X) = \sum_{k = 1}^{C} p(X \mid Y = k)\]

Is hugely important for a number of reasons:
- fundamental equation for probabilistic machine learning
	- allows clean uncertainty handling (among others)
- puts model accuracy into perspective (what is good or bad)
- defines two fundamental _model types_:
	- **discriminative model:** learns \(p(Y = k \mid X)\) (right side)
		- answers the question "what class" directly
		- **(+)** relatively easy -- take the direct route, no detour
		- **(-)** often hard to interpret _how_ the model makes decisions (black box)
	- **generative model:** learns \(p(Y = k)\) and \(p(X \mid Y = k)\) (left side)
		- first learn how "the world" works, then use this to answer the question
			- \(p(X \mid Y = k)\) -- understand the mechanism how observations ("phenotypes") arise from hidden properties
		- **(-)** pretty hard -- need powerful models and a lot of data
		- **(+)** easily interpretable -- we can know why it was answered

- ex.: breast cancer screening: \(p(Y = 1) = 0.001, p(Y = -1) = 0.999\)
	- a test answers the following
		- correct diagnosis: \(p(X = 1 \mid Y = 1) = 0.99\)
		- false positive: \(p(X = 1 \mid Y = -1) = 0.01\)
	-  _if the test is positive, should you panic?_ \[\begin{aligned} p(Y = 1 \mid X = 1) &= \frac{p(X = 1 \mid Y = 1) p(Y = 1)}{p(X)} \\ &= \frac{0.99 \cdot 0.001}{0.99 \cdot 0.001 + 0.01 \cdot 0.999} \\ &\approx \mathbf{0.1}
\end{aligned}\]
		- due to the very low probability of the disease, you're likely fine

Some history behind ML:
- traditional science seeks generative models (we can create synthetic data that are indistinguishable from real data)
	- physics understand the movement of an object, so a game can use this to appear real
- ~1930: ML researches realized that their models were too weak to do this \(\implies\) field switched to discriminative models
- ~2012: neural networks solved many hard discriminative tasks \(\implies\) the field is again interested in generative models (Midjourney, ChatGPT, etc.)
	- subfield "explainable/interpretable ML"

##### How good can it be?
{% math ENdefinition "Bayes classifier" %}uses Bayes rule (LHS or RHS) with true probabilities \(p^*\){% endmath %}
- we don't know \(p^*\), we want to get as close as possible

{% math ENtheorem %}no learned classifier using \(\hat{p}\) can be better than the Bayes classifier.{% endmath %}
- if our results are bad, we have to get better theory (more features)

##### How bad can it be?
- case 1: **all classes are equally probable** (\(p(Y = k) = \frac{1}{C}\))
	- worst classifier: pure guessing -- correct \(50\%\) of the time
- case 2: **unbalanced classes**
	- worst classifier: always return the majority label

#### Linear classification
1. use a linear formula to reduce all features to scaled score
2. apply threshold classifier to score (\(C = 2\) for now)

\[\hat{Y}_i = \mathrm{sign}\left(\sum_{j} \beta_j X_{ij} + b\right)\]
for feature weights \(\beta\) and intercept \(b\).

- learning means finding \(\hat{\beta}\) and \(\hat{b}\)
- we can also get rid of \(b\) by one of the following:
	1. if all classes are balanced (\(p(Y = k) = \frac{1}{C}\)) then we can centralize features 
\[\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} X_i \qquad \overset{0}{X_i} = X_i - \bar{X}_i\]
	2. absorb \(b\) into \(X\): define new feature \(X_{i0} = 1\) (will then act as \(b\))
		- done quite often (\(X_{i0}\) is then called the "bias neuron")

##### Perceptron
- Rosenblatt, 1958
- first neural network (1 neuron)
- idea: improve \(\beta\) when model makes mistakes
	- **naive approach** -- **0/1 loss:** \[\mathcal{L}(\hat{Y}_i, Y^*_i) = \begin{cases} 0 & \hat{Y}_i = Y^*_i \\ 1 & \hat{Y}_i \neq Y^*_i \end{cases}\]
		- can be used to **evaluate** but **doesn't tell us how to improve** (and how)
	- **better idea** -- **perceptron loss:** weigh penalty by error magnitude (and use \(\mathrm{ReLU}\)) \[\mathcal{L}(\hat{Y}_i, Y^*_i) = \mathrm{ReLU}(-Y_i X_i \beta) = \begin{cases} 0 & \hat{Y}_i = Y^*_i \\ |X_i \beta| = -Y_i X_i \beta & \hat{Y}_i \neq Y^*_i \end{cases}\]
		- note that these are only for one instance, for all the average error is \[\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \mathrm{ReLU} (-Y_i^* X_i \beta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i: \hat{Y}_i \neq Y_i^*} -Y_i^* X_i \beta\]

Gradient descent looks as follows: \[\beta^{(t)} = \beta^{(t - 1)} - \tau \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^{(t - 1)}}{\partial \beta}}_{\text{loss derivative}}\] for **learning rate** \(\tau \ll 1\) In our case, the derivative (for a single instance) is \[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^{(t - 1)}}{\partial \beta} = \frac{\partial \mathrm{ReLU} (-Y_i X_i \beta)}{\partial \beta} = \begin{cases} 0 & -Y_i^* X_i \beta < 0\ \ \text{(correct)} \\ -Y_i^* X_i^T & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]

##### Rosenblatt's algorithm

{% math ENalgorithm "Rosenblatt's algorithm" %}

1. initialzation of \(\beta^{(0)}\) -- random/uniform numbers
2. for \(t = 1, \ldots, T\) (or until convergence)
	- update \(\beta\) using the gradient descent formula above, with minor changes:
		- additionally, use \(\tau / N\) instead of \(\tau\) (so it doesn't change when learning set changes)
		- sum over only incorrect guesses from the previous iteration
\[\boxed{\beta^{(t)} = \beta^{(t - 1)} + \frac{\tau}{N} \sum_{i: \hat{Y}_i^{(t - 1)} \neq Y_i^*} Y_i^* X_i^T}\]
{% endmath %}

- only converges when the data is "linearly separable" (i.e. \(\exists \beta\) for loss \(0\))

![Linear classifier.](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/linear-classifier.svg)

- **(+)** first practical learning algorithm, established the gradient descent principle
- **(-)** only converges when the training set area linearly separable
- **(-)** tends to overfit, bad at generalization

##### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Improved algorithm (popular around 1995): **(Linear) Support Vector Machine** (SVM)
- maintain a safety region around data where solution should not be
- closest points -- **support vectors**
- learns \(\hat{Y} = \argmax_k p(Y = k \mid X)\), which is LHS of Bayes -- is **discriminative**

Reminder: distance of a point \(X_i\) and plane \(\beta, b\) is \[d(X_i, (\beta, b)) = \left| \frac{ X_i \beta + b}{|| \beta ||} \right|\]
- notice that scaling \(\beta\) doesn't change the distance -- pairs \((\tau \beta, \tau b)\) define the same plane -- we can therefore define an equivalence class \[H = \left\{\beta', b' \mid \beta' = \tau \beta_H, b' = \tau b_H\right\}\] for \(\beta_H, b_H\) representatives (can be chosen arbitrarily)

Radius of the safety region (**margin**) is the **smallest distance** distance of a point to the decision plane (also called the "Hausdorff distance between H and TS"): \[m_H = \min_{i = 1}^N d(X_i, (\beta_H, b_H))\]

Let \(\hat{i}\) be the closest point. Then \[Y_{\hat{i}}^* (X_{\hat{i}} \beta_H + b_H) = m_H || \beta_H || \]
- we don't use minus because we want distance, not penalty (like perceptron)
- we again use the trick with multiplying by the label and brought the norm to the other side

Now we chose a representative such that the equation above is \(1\).
The decision plane is then correct when \[\forall i: Y_i^* (X_i \beta_H + b_H) \ge 1\] (specifically \(1\) for \(\hat{i}\)). To make it as general as possible, we want one that maximizes the distance \[
\begin{aligned}
	H &= \argmax_H m_H \\
	&= \argmax_H \left(\min_i \frac{Y_i^* (X_i \beta_H + b_H)}{ ||\beta_H ||}\right) \\
	&= \argmax_H \left(\frac{1}{|| \beta_H  ||} \min_i Y_i^* (X_i \beta_H + b_H))\right) \\
	&= \arg \max_H \frac{1}{|| \beta_H || }
\end{aligned}
\]

This yields an optimization problem: we want to \[\argmax_H \frac{1}{|| \beta_H || } \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \forall i:  Y_i^* (X_i \beta_H + b_H) \ge 1\]

This is inconvenient -- change to a more convenient equivalent optimization problem \[\argmin_H \frac{1}{2} \beta_H^T \beta_H \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \forall i:  Y_i^* (X_i \beta_H + b_H) \ge 1\]

Now we define slack variables \(\xi_i \ge 0\) that measure how much it was violated \[\argmin_H \frac{1}{2} \beta_H^T \beta_H \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \forall i:  Y_i^* (X_i \beta_H + b_H) \ge 1 - \xi_i\] and we also want to minimize those, which we'll do by using **Lagrange multipliers:** \[\boxed{\argmin_{H, \xi} \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \beta_H^T \beta_H}_{\text{maximize margins}} + \underbrace{\frac{\lambda}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \mathrm{ReLU} (1 - Y_i^* (X_i \beta_H + b_H))}_{\text{minimize penalties for misclassified points}}}\]

- adjusting \(\lambda\) makes compromise between being right vs. robust (**hyperparameter tuning**):
	1. **approach:** 3 datasets -- training, validation, testing
		- pick a set of possible hyperparameters (\(\lambda \in \left\{10^{-2}, 10^{-1}, 1, 10, 100\right\}\))
		- train with each \(\lambda\) on the training set
		- measure accuracy on the validation set
		- keep the best \(\lambda\) on validation set, test again on the test set
		- validation is present because test set would otherwise be training too...
	2. **approach** (2 datasets): **cross-validation**
		- split training set into \(k\) pieces ("folds", typically \(k\) around \(5\) or \(10\))
			- _has to be randomly ordered, otherwise it won't work!_
		- use each fold as validation set in turn & train on the remaining \(k-1\) folds
		- special variation: \(n\)-fold (train on everything besides one instance)
			- expensive in practice, great in theory
- comparing with perceptron:
	- we introduced \(b\) (no normalization)
	- we now have a regularization term (no overfitting!)
	- we have \(1 - \ldots\): if you're barely right, you still pay small penalties!

We again optimize by derivative + gradient descent:

\[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \beta} = \beta + \frac{\lambda }{N} \sum_{i = Y_i^* X_i \beta + b < 1}^{N} -Y_i^* X_i^T\]
\[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b} = \frac{\lambda }{N} \sum_{i = Y_i^* X_i \beta + b < 1}^{N} -Y_i^*\]

The iteration step for \(\beta\) looks as follows: \[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
	\beta^{(t)} &= \beta^{(t - 1)} - \tau \left(\beta^{(t - 1)} + \frac{\lambda }{N} \sum_{i = Y_i^* X_i \beta + b < 1}^{N} -Y_i^* X_i^T\right) \\
	b^{(t)} &= b^{(t - 1)} - \tau \left(\frac{\lambda}{N} \sum_{i = Y_i^* X_i \beta + b < 1}^{N} -Y_i^*\right)
\end{aligned}
}
\]
- note that we can't get stuck in a minimum, since the objective function is convex

##### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- idea: assume that features for each class form a cluster
	- assume they're elliptic and model each one as a Gaussian distribution
- is RHS of Bayes (**generative**) -- calculate the posterior from Bayes formula
- **Linear** -- clusters have the same shape
	- there is also a **Quadratic**, which permits different shapes but isn't linear

To get any ellipse, we start with a unit circle \(z\) and stretch (\(\lambda\)), rotate (\(Q\)) and shift (\(\mu\)) it: \[Q \lambda z + \mu = \begin{pmatrix} \cos \varphi & -\sin \varphi \\ \sin \varphi & \cos \varphi \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 & 0 \\ 0 & x_2 \end{pmatrix} z + \mu\]

![Derivation of an ellipse from a unit circle.](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/ellipses.svg)

Solving for \(z\) (and using the fact that \(Q\) is orthogonal), we get \[z = \lambda^{-1} Q^{-1} (X - \mu) = \lambda^{-1} Q^T (X - \mu)\]

**Gaussian distribution** can be defined as\[\mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \left((x - \mu)\sigma^{-1}\right)^2\right)\]
- for \(\mu \ldots\) **mean**, \(\sigma \ldots\) **variance**
- **standard normal distribution** is for \(\mu = 0\) and \(\sigma = 1\)

For higher dimensions (with our circle \(z\)), we get the generalized Gaussian \[\mathcal{N}(z \mid \mu, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det\left(2 \pi \Sigma\right)}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} (x - \mu) \underbrace{Q^{-1}\lambda^{-1}\lambda^{-1}Q^{-T}}_{\Sigma^{-1}} (x - \mu)^T\right)\]
- \(\Sigma^{-1} = K\) is the **precision matrix**
- since \(\Sigma^{-1} = Q^{-1}\lambda^{-1}\lambda^{-1}Q^{-T}\), we see a decomposition to eigenvalues (correspond to square of radii of the ellipse) and eigenvectors (the corresponding radii vectors)

Let \(\left\{X-i\right\}_{i = 1}^{N_1}\) be features of class \(1\). Then \[N(X \mid \mu_1, \Sigma_1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det(2 \pi \Sigma_1)}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} (x_1 - \mu_1) \Sigma_1^{-1} (x_1 - \mu_1)^T\right)\]
- **learning:** find \(\mu_1\) and \(\Sigma_1\)

To derive the learning method, we'll use two things:
1. **maximum likelihood principle**: choose \(\mu_1\) and \(\Sigma_1\) such that TS will be a _typical outcome of the resulting model_ (i.e. best model maximizes the likelihood of TS)
2. **i.i.d. assumption:** training instances drawn independently from the same distribution
	- **i**ndependently -- joint distribution is the product
	- **i**dentically **d**istributed -- all instances come from the same distribution

For the probability, we get \[
\begin{aligned}
	p(\mathrm{TS}) &= p(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \\
	               &= \prod_{i = 1}^{N} p_i(X_i) \qquad \text{independently} \\
	               &= \prod_{i = 1}^{N} p(X_i) \qquad \text{identically distributed} \\
	               &= \prod_{i = 1}^{N} \mathcal{N(X_i \mid \mu, \Sigma)}
\end{aligned}\]

Using the maximum likelihood principle, the problem becomes \[\hat{\mu}, \hat{\Sigma} = \argmax_{\mu, \Sigma} p(\mathrm{TS})\]

It's mathematically simpler to minimize negative logarithm of \(p(\mathrm{TS})\) (applying monotonic function to an optimization problem doesn't change \(\argmin\) and \(\max = -\min\)). We get

\[
\begin{aligned}
	\hat{\mu}, \hat{\Sigma} &= \argmin_{\mu, \Sigma} -\log(p(\mathrm{TS})) \\ 
	                        &= - \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left[\log \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\det(2 \pi \Sigma)}}\right) - \frac{1}{2} (X_i - \mu) \Sigma^{-1} (X_i - \mu)^T\right] \\
	                        &= \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left[\log \left(\det(2 \pi \Sigma)\right) + (X_i - \mu) \Sigma^{-1} (X_i - \mu)^T\right] = \mathcal{L}(\mathrm{TS})
\end{aligned}
\]

This is our loss. We now do derivative and set it to \(0\), since that will find the optimum. First, we'll derivate by \(\mu\), which gets rid of the first part of loss completely and we get

\[
\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{ \partial \mu} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \overbrace{\Sigma^{-1} (X_i -\mu)^T}^{\frac{\partial vAv^T}{\partial v} = 2Av^T} &= 0 \\
	                                             \sum_{i = 1}^{N}             (X_i -\mu)^T &= 0 \\
	                                             \sum_{i = 1}^{N} X_i &= N \mu \\
	                                             \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} X_i &= \mu \\
\end{aligned}
\]

In other words, the **mean \(\mu\) is the average** (shocking, I know).

For \(\Sigma\), this will be a little more complicated. We'll do the partial derivation by \(\Sigma^{-1} = K\) instead, which gives the following:
\[
\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{ \partial K} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} [ \overbrace{-(K^T)^{-1}}^{\frac{\partial \log \det K}{\partial K} = (K^T)^{-1}} + \overbrace{(X_i - \mu)^T (X_i - \mu)}^{\frac{\partial vAv^T}{\partial A} = v^Tv}] &= 0 \\
	                                          \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left[ -K^{-1} + (X_i - \mu)^T (X_i - \mu)\right] &= 0 \qquad K\ \text{symmetric} \\
	                                          -N K^{-1} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N} (X_i - \mu)^T (X_i - \mu) &= 0 \\
	                                         \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} (X_i - \mu)^T (X_i - \mu) &= \Sigma \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Again, in other words, the **variance** is the average over the quared vectors offset by the mean, which too makes sense.

Now we have \(2\) clases but with same covariance (by assumption of LDA) and we can:
1. determine two means (\(\mu_1, \mu_{-1}\)) as \[\boxed{\mu_1 = \frac{1}{N_1} \sum_{i: Y_i^* = 1} X_i \qquad \mu_{-1} = \frac{1}{N_{-1}} \sum_{i: Y_i^* = -1}}\]
2. to calculate covariance (which is the same for both classes): \[\boxed{\Sigma = \frac{1}{N} \left(\sum_{i: Y_i^* = 1} (X_i - \mu_1)^T (X_i - \mu_1) + \sum_{i: Y_i^* = -1} (X_i - \mu_{-1})^T (X_i - \mu_{-1})\right)}\]
3. use Bayes RHS and our calculations to calculate the LHS: \[\boxed{\begin{aligned} \hat{Y}_i = \mathrm{sign}(X_i \beta + b) \quad \text{with} \quad &\beta = 2 \Sigma^{-1} (\mu_1 - \mu_{-1})^T \\ & b = \mu_{-1} \Sigma^{-1} \mu_{-1}^T - \mu_1 \Sigma^{-1} \mu_1^T \end{aligned}}\]

The derivation of (3) looks as follows: assuming \(p(Y = 1) = p(Y = -1) = \frac{1}{2}\) for simpler computations and \(p(Y = -1 \mid X)\) being analogous:

\[
\begin{aligned}
 p(Y=1|X)&=\frac{p(Y=1|X){p(Y=1)}}{p(Y=1|X){p(Y=1)}+p(Y=-1|X){p(Y=-1)}}\\            
 &=\frac{p(Y=1|X)}{p(Y=1|X)+p(Y=-1|X)}\\                                              
 &=\frac{1}{1+\frac{p(X|Y=-1)}{p(X|Y=1)}}
\end{aligned}
\]

Now we substitute the Gaussian function:

\[
\begin{aligned}
 \frac{p(X_i|{Y=-1})}{p(X_i|{Y=1})}&=\frac{\cancel{\frac{1}{\sqrt{\det(2\pi\Sigma)}}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(X_i-\mu_{-1})\Sigma^{-1}(X_i-\mu_{-1})^T)}{\cancel{\frac{1}{\sqrt{\det(2\pi\Sigma)}}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(X_i-\mu_{1})\Sigma^{-1}(X_i-\mu_{1})^T)}\\
 &=\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(X_i-\mu_{-1})\Sigma^{-1}(X_i-\mu_{-1})^T+\frac{1}{2}(X_i-\mu_{1})\Sigma^{-1}(X_i-\mu_{1})^T) \\
 &=\exp(-\frac{1}{2}\left[\cancel{X\Sigma^{-1}X^T}-2X\Sigma^{-1}\mu_{-1}^T+\mu_{-1}\Sigma^{-1}\mu_{-1}^T-\cancel{X\Sigma^{-1}X^T}+2X\Sigma^{-1}\mu_1^T-\mu_1\Sigma^{-1}\mu_{1}^T\right])\\
 &=\exp(-X\underbrace{\Sigma^{-1}(\mu_1^T-\mu_{-1}^T)}_\beta-\frac{1}{2}\underbrace{(\mu_{-1}\Sigma^{-1}\mu_{-1}^T-\mu_1\Sigma^{-1}\mu_1^T)}_b)=\exp(-(X\beta+b))
\end{aligned}
\]

Plugging the result into the previous equation, we obtain the sigmoid function \(\sigma\):

\[p(Y = 1 \mid X) = \frac{1}{1 + \mathrm{exp}(-(X \beta + b))} \qquad \sigma(t) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-t)}\]

Two of its properties will be helpful for us: \[\sigma(-t) = 1 - \sigma(t) \qquad \frac{\partial \sigma(t)}{\partial t} = \sigma(t) \sigma(-t)\]

Doing an analogous derivation for \(p(Y = -1 \mid X)\), we get \[
\begin{aligned}
\hat y=\arg\max_k p(Y=k|X) \Longleftrightarrow& \begin{cases}1 &\text{if } \sigma(X\beta+b)>\frac{1}{2}\\ -1 &\text{if } \sigma(X\beta+b)<\frac{1}{2}\end{cases}\\
\Longleftrightarrow& \begin{cases}1 &\text{if } X\beta+b>0\\ -1 &\text{if } X\beta+b<0\end{cases}\\
\Longleftrightarrow& \text{sign}(X\beta+b)
\end{aligned}\]


**Alternatives to training beta and b:**
1. fit mean and covariance of clusters
2. least-squares regression: \(\mathcal{L}(Y_i^*, \hat{Y}_i) = (Y_i^* - (X \beta + b))^2\) (same solution as \(1\))
3. Fisher's idea: define 1D scores \(Z_i = X_i \beta\) and chose \(\beta\) such that a threshold on \(Z_i\) has minimum error
	- define projection of the means \(\hat{\mu_{1}} = \mu_1 \beta, \hat{\mu_{-1}} = \mu_{-1}\beta\)
	- **intuition:** \(\hat{\mu}_1\) and \(\hat{\mu_{-1}}\) should be as far away as possible \[\beta = \argmax_\beta (\hat{\mu}_1 - \hat{\mu}_{-1})^2\]
	- doesn't quite work, because \(\tau \beta \implies \tau^2 (\hat{\mu}_{1} \hat{\mu}_{-1})\)
	- solution: scale by the variance \(\hat{\sigma}\): \(\hat{\sigma}_1 = \mathrm{Var}\left(Z_1 \mid Y_i^* = 1\right), \hat{\sigma}_{-1} \mathrm{Var}\left(Z_i \mid Y_i^* = -1\right)\), then we get \[\hat{\beta} = \argmax_{\beta} \frac{\left(\hat{\mu}_1 - \hat{\mu_{-1}}\right)^2}{\hat{\sigma}_1^2 + \hat{\sigma}_{-1}^2}\]
	- again gives the same solution as \(1\) and \(2\)
4. **Logistic regression (LR):** same posterior as LDA, but learn LHS of Bayes rule
	- gives different solution to LDA

##### Logistic regression (LR)

We again have i.i.d. assumptions -- all labels are drawn independently form the same posterior: \[p\left(\left(Y_i^*\right)_{i = 1}^N \mid \left(X_i\right)_{i = 1}^N\right) = \prod_{i = 1}^{N} p(Y_i^* \mid X_i)\]
- as a reminder, this was **swapped for LDA** (we had \(p(X \mid Y)\))
- use **maximum likelihood**: choose \(\hat{\beta}, \hat{b}\) such that posterior of TS is maximized: \[
\begin{aligned}
&\hat\beta,\hat b=\argmax_{\beta,b}\prod^N_{i=1}p(Y^*_i|X_i)\\
\Longleftrightarrow&\hat\beta,\hat b=\arg\min_{\beta,b}-\sum^N_{i=1}\log p(Y^*_i|X_i) \qquad \min + \log \text{ trick}
\end{aligned}\]

For LR, \(Y^*_i \in \left\{0, 1\right\}\), which allows us to rewrite (with the \(\sigma\) results from LDA) like so: \[
\boxed{\ \hat{\beta}, \hat{b}=\arg\min_{\beta, b}-\sum_{i=1}^N\Big[Y_i^* \log \sigma\left(X\beta+b\right)+\left(1-Y_i^*\right) \log \left(\sigma\left(-\left(X\beta+b\right)\right)\Big]\right.\ }
\]
- no analytic solution but **is convex** (local extreme = global extreme, solve via GD)

Here we have \(-\log(\sigma(-t)) = \log(1 + \exp(t))\), which is called the **softplus** function:

![ReLu + Softplus graphs.](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/relu-softplus.svg)

Simplifying for \(b = 0\) and using the following properties:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \sigma\left(X\beta\right)}{\partial \beta}&=\sigma^{\prime}\left(X\beta\right) X=\sigma(X \beta) \sigma\left(-X\beta\right) \cdot X \\
\frac{\partial \log \sigma\left(X\beta\right)}{\partial \beta}&=\frac{1}{\sigma\left(X\beta\right)} \sigma\left(X\beta\right) \sigma\left(-X\beta\right) \cdot X=\sigma\left(X\beta\right) \cdot X \\
\frac{\partial \log \sigma\left(-X\beta\right)}{\partial \beta}&=\frac{1}{\sigma\left(-X\beta\right)} \sigma\left(X\beta\right) \sigma\left(-X\beta\right) \cdot(-X)=-\sigma\left(X\beta\right) \cdot X
\end{aligned}
\]

We get the derivatives \(\beta\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mathcal Loss(T S)}{\partial \beta}&=-\sum_{i=1}^N\left[Y_i^* \underbrace{\sigma\left(-X_i \beta\right)}_{1-\sigma\left(X_i \beta\right)} \cdot X_i+\left(1-Y_i^*\right) \sigma\left(X_{i \beta}\right) \cdot\left(-X_i\right)\right] \\
& =-\sum_{i=1}^N\left[Y_i^* X_i-\cancel{Y_i^* \sigma\left(X_i \beta\right) X_i}-\sigma\left(X_i \beta\right) X_i+\cancel{Y_i^* \sigma\left(X_i \beta\right) X_i}\right]
\end{aligned}
\]

obtaining

\[
\boxed{\ \frac{\partial \mathcal Loss(T S)}{\partial \beta}=\sum_{i=1}^N(\underbrace{\sigma\left(X_i \beta\right)-Y_i^*}_{\text {error }}) \cdot X_i \stackrel{!}{=} 0\ }
\]

The four cases that can occur are as follows:

| Real value \ Classifier result | \(\sigma(X_i\beta)\approx 1\)                               | \(\sigma(X_i\beta)\approx 0\)                               |
| ---                            | ---                                                         | ---                                                         |
| \(Y^*_i=1\)                    | no correction                                               | error \(\approx-1\): pulls \(\sigma(X_i\beta)\rightarrow1\) |
| \(Y^*_i=0\)                    | error \(\approx 1\): pulls \(\sigma(X_i\beta)\rightarrow0\) | no correction                                               |

##### Summary
- with \(Y \in \left\{-1, 1\right\}\), all methods have same decision rule \[\hat Y_i = \mathrm{sign}(X_i \beta + b)\] but the methods differ by how they define & find optimal \(\beta, b\)
- common objective function \[\hat \beta, \hat b = \argmin_{\beta, b} = \frac{\lambda}{2} \underbrace{\beta^T \beta}_{\text{regularization}} + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \underbrace{\mathcal{Loss} (Y_i^*, X_i \beta + b)}_{\text{data term}} \]

**Perceptron:** \[\mathrm{ReLU}(-Y_i^* (X_i \beta + b)) \qquad \lambda = 0\]

**SVM:** \[\mathrm{ReLU}(1 - Y_i^* (X_i \beta + b)) \qquad \lambda > 0\]

**LDA:** \[(Y_i^* - (X_i \beta + b))^2 \qquad \lambda = 0\ (\text{fit } \mu, \Sigma),\ \lambda > 0\ (\text{fit objective})\]

**LR:** \[\mathrm{softplus}(-Y_i^* (X_i \beta + b)) \qquad \lambda = 0\ (\text{or >})\]

- in practice, similar solutions when data is linearly separable
- different tradeoffs otherwise \(\implies\) check validation set

![Linear classifier.](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/summary.svg)

##### Multi-class classification
- solution: reduce to a set of \(2\)-class problems

1. one-against-rest classification
	- for \(k = 1, \ldots, C\), define \(\beta_k, b_k \implies\) score \(s_k = X_i \beta_k + b_k\)
	- train by treating \(Y_i^* = k\) as "class + 1" and \(Y_i^* \neq k\) as "class - 1" (rest)
	- make them comparable by normalization: \(\hat{\beta}_k = \frac{\beta_k}{\|\beta_k\|}\) (same for \(b\))
	- classify according to biggest score, or "don't know" if all scores are bad: \[\hat{Y}_i = \begin{cases} \text{"unknown"} & s_k < \varepsilon,\ \forall k \\ \argmax_k s_k & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}\]
2. all-pairs: train a linear model for all \(k, k'\) (\(\approx n^2\))
	- \(s_{k, k'} = X_i \beta_{k, k'} + b_{k, k'},\ \forall k \neq k'\)
	- if \(s_{k, k'} > 0\) then one vote for class \(k\), if \(s_{k, k'} < 0\) then one vote for \(k'\)
	- \(\hat{Y}_i\) is the label with most votes (or "unknown" for ties)
3. define posterior as "softmax-function" scores as in (1): \[\boxed{p(\hat Y_i = k \mid X_i) = \frac{\exp(s_k)}{\sum_{k' = 1}^{C} \exp(s_k')} = \mathrm{softmax}(s_i, s_k)}\]
	- standard for neural network classification
	- easily provable: \(\mathrm{softmax}(s_1, s_2) = \sigma(s_1 - s_2)\)
	- new: train all \(\beta_k, b_k\) **jointly** (at the same time)

#### Non-linear classification
- _in practice, use LR and hope for the best_
- exception: very scarce data \(\implies\) hard to justify non-linear fit

1. measure more features and _increase dimension_
	- higher dimensional spaces tend to be more linearly separable
	- for \(N = D + 1\), it's always separable (but maybe not useful)
	- for \(D > N\), use _sparse_ learning methods
2. use non-linear classifier
	- QDA, which is a non-linear version of LDA
	- Kernel-SVM (non-linear SVM, less popular but cool math)
	- Decision trees/forests (recursively subdivide \(X\), we'll discuss them later)
3. non-linearly transform features \(\tilde{X}_i = \varphi(X_i)\)
	- **XOR function:** \(x_1, x_2 \in \left\{-1, 1\right\}\), \(y_i^* = \begin{cases} +1 & x_1 \neq x_2 \\ -1 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\)
	- **four points classification:** \(\tilde{x} = x_1 \cdot x_2, \hat{y} = \begin{cases} +1 & \tilde x < 0 \\ -1 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\)
	- **BMI** (non-linear formula, linear classification)
	- _problem:_ hand-crafting \(\varphi\) is difficult
	- _solution:_ learn \(\varphi\) (multi-layer neural networks)

### Neural networks
- **definition:** inputs \(z_{\mathrm{in}}\) eg. (\(z_{\mathrm{in}} = X\) or \(z_{\mathrm{in}} = \) output of other neurons)
- **computation (activation):** \(z_{\mathrm{out}} = \varphi(z_{\mathrm{in}} \beta + b)\) (linear function plugged into non-linear one)
	- **pre-activation:** \(\tilde{z} = z_{\mathrm{in}} \beta + b\)
	- popular activation functions: \(\varphi\)
		- **identity:** used as output of regression networks
		- **classic choices:** \(\sigma\) or \(\tanh\), almost the same when scaled / offset
		- **modern choices:**
			- \(\mathrm{ReLU}\) -- not differentiable at \(0\) but nice in practice
			- leaky \(\mathrm{ReLU} = \begin{cases} x & x > 0 \\ \alpha x & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\)
			- exponential linear unit \(\mathrm{ELU}(x) = \begin{cases} x & x > 0 \\ \alpha (e^x - 1) & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\)
			- swish function \(x \cdot \sigma(x)\)

- usually, \(b\) is not used but turned into a "bias neuron" for each layer

A **neural network** is a collection of neurons in parallel layers
- _fully-connected:_ all neurons of previous layer connect to those of the next
- for \(4\) layers, we have \(z_0 = [1, x]\) (bias), \(z_1, z_2\) hidden and \(z_3 = y\)
- sample computation would then be \[\begin{aligned}
	y &= \varphi_3([1; z_2] B_3) \\
	  &= \varphi_3 ([1; \varphi_2 ([1; z_1] B_2)] B_3) \\
	  &= \varphi_3 ([1; \varphi_2 ([1; \varphi_1([1; z_0 \cdot B_1])] B_2)] B_3) \\
\end{aligned}\]

![Network example.](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/network.svg)
- (1) is the input, (2-5) are hidden layers, (6) is the output

Previously, NN were believed to not be a good idea, but
- ~2005: GPUs were found out to compute them well
- big data became available (to train the big network)
- ~2012: starts outperforming everything else

**Activation functions:**
- \(\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_{L - 1}\) (not for input): chosen by the designer
	- nowadays we usually use one of the modern choices described above
- \(\varphi_{L}\): determined by application
	- **regression** (\(Y \in \mathbb{R}\)): **identity**
	- **classification** (\(p(Y = k \mid X)\)): \(\mathrm{softmax}\)

**Important theorems:**
1. neural networks with \(L \ge 2\) (\(= 1\) hidden layer) are **universal approximators** (can approximate any function to any accuracy), if there are enough neurons in the hidden layer
	- purely existential proof, but nice to know
	- up till 2005, this was used, since they were enough
		- bad idea -- deeper networks are easier to train (many good local optima)
2. finding the optimal network is NP-hard \(\implies\) we need approximation algorithms

**Training by backpropagation (chain rule)**
- idea: train \(B_1, \ldots, B_L\) by gradient descent \(\implies\) need \(\frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial B_l}\)
- update is the same as previous GD: \[\boxed{B_l^{(t)} = B_l^{(t - 1)} - \tau \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial B_l^{(t - 1)}}}\]
- to compute the derivative, we'll compute the chain rule from last layer backwards

1. \(\frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial z_L}\) (application-dependent loss)
	- **regression:** \[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{Loss} &= \frac{1}{2} \left(z_L - Y_i^*\right)^2 \\ \frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial z_L} &= z_L - Y_i^* \end{aligned}\]
	- **classification:** \[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{Loss} &= \sum_{k = 1}^{C} \mathbb{1} \mathbb{I} \left[k = Y_i^*\right] -\log \underbrace{p(Y = k \mid X)}_{z_{Lk}} \\ \frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial z_{Lk}} &= \begin{cases} - \frac{1}{z_{Lk}} & k = Y_i^* \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \end{aligned}\]

2. back-propagate through output activation \(\varphi_L (\tilde z_L)\)
	- here we define \(\tilde{\delta}_L = \frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial \tilde z_L}\) since we'll use it a lot
	- for **regression**, we had identity activation function so \[z_L = \varphi_L(\tilde z_L) = \tilde z_L \implies \tilde{\delta}_L = \tilde z_L - Y_i^*\]
	- for **classification**, this is a bit more complicated but ends up being \[\boxed{\tilde{\delta}_L = \begin{cases} z_{Lk} - 1 & k = Y_i^* \\ z_{Lk} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}}\]

3. for every \(l = 1, \ldots, L\), let \(\tilde \delta_l = \frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial \tilde z_l}\); recursion starts with \(\tilde \delta_L\) (previous step)
	- use chain rule (and simplify/compute using previous layers): \[\begin{aligned}
		\boxed{\tilde \delta_{l - 1} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial \tilde z_{l - 1}}} &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial \tilde z_l} \cdot \frac{\partial z_l}{\partial z_{l - 1}} \cdot \frac{\partial z_{l - 1}}{\partial \tilde z_{l - 1}} \\
		&= \boxed{\tilde \delta_l \cdot B_l^T \cdot \mathrm{diag}(\varphi'(\tilde z_{l - 1}))}
	\end{aligned}\]

4. another chain rule, finally with what we want to calculate: \[\begin{aligned} \boxed{\frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial B_l}} &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{Loss}}{\partial \tilde z_l} \cdot \frac{\partial \tilde z_l}{\partial B_l} \\ &= \boxed{\tilde z_{l - 1} \cdot \tilde \delta_l} & \end{aligned}\]

**Training algorithm:**
1. init \(B_l\) randomly (explained later)
2. for \(t = 1, \ldots, T\)
	1. forward pass -- for \(i\) in batch
		- \(z_0 = [1, X_i]\)
		- for  \(l = 1, \ldots, L\), compute + store \(z_l, \tilde{z}_l\) along the way
	2. backward pass: \(\Delta B_l = 0\), for \(i\) in batch
		- compute \(\tilde \delta_L\)
		- for \(l = L, \ldots, 1\), compute
			- \(\Delta B_l \mathrel{+}= \tilde z_{l - 1}^T \cdot \tilde \delta_l\)
			- \(\tilde \delta_{l - 1} = \tilde \delta_l \cdot \left(B_{l}^{(t - 1)}\right)^T \cdot \mathrm{diag}\left(\varphi'_{l - 1}\left(\tilde z_{l - 1}\right)\right)\)
	3. update: \(B_l^{(t)} = B_l^{(t - 1)} - \tau \Delta B_l\)

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- previously, we had **fully connected** networks
	- work well for ~1000-dimensional data (can handle MNIST)
- CNNs are typically used for images, neurons are **sparsely connected**
	- every CNN can be implemented as a (much larger) fully connected network
	- neurons are only connected based on its _top_ (see below)
- idea: objects in images **don't change when at different location**
	- classification should be _translation invariant_
	- the learned features should be _translation equivariant_ 
		- when dog moves, features move in the same way
	- these are two of the defining ideas of a **convolution**

{% math ENdefinition "filter" %}consumes an image and outputs another "filtered" image{% endmath %}
\[\tilde f(t) = \mathrm{Filter\left[f(t)\right]}\]

For our filter, we want **translation equivariance** \[\tilde f(t) = \mathrm{Filter}\left[f(t)\right] \implies \tilde f(t + t_0) = \mathrm{Filter}\left[f(t + t_0)\right]\]
and **linearity** \[\tilde f(t), \tilde g(t) \implies \alpha_1 \tilde f(t) + \alpha_2 \tilde g(t) = \mathrm{Filter}\left[\alpha_1 f(t) + \alpha_2 g(t)\right]\]

{% math ENtheorem %}any such filter can be written as a convolution integral, i.e. \[\tilde f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t') \cdot \underbrace{g(t - t')}_{\text{filter kernel}} dt' = (f \otimes g) (t)\]{% endmath %}

Substituting \(t'' = t - t'\), we see that the operation is **commutative:** \[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t - t'') \cdot g(t'') dt'' = (g \otimes f)(t)\]

Since we don't have infinite images, \(t = \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\), the integral becomes a sum: \[\boxed{\tilde f_t = \sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{t'} \cdot g_{t - t'}}\]

Trick: if we want to find \(g(t)\) of a black-box filter, take \(f(t) = \delta(t)\) ([Dirac delta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function)), then \[\tilde f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t') \cdot g(t - t') dt' = g(t)\]

Usually, \(g(t)\) has a finite support, i.e. \(g(t) \equiv 0\) if \(|t| > T\), then we get \[\tilde f(t) = \sum_{t' = -T}^{T} f_{t - t'} g_{t'}\]
- \(g(t)\) has \(2T + 1\) non-zero elements so it's called the \("2T + 1"\)-tap filter
	- \(T = 1 \implies\) 3-tap filter (in 2D \(3 \times 3\))
	- \(T = 2 \implies\) 5-tap filter (in 2D \(5 \times 5\))

Why is this useful? -- "matched filter principle"
- \(\tilde f(t)\) is big if \(f(t)\) around \(t\) is similar ("matched") to \(g(0)\)
- the kernel of the filter encodes the pattern of interest (matches similar features)

![Matched filter example.](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/matched-filter.webp)

If we repeat this in multiple layers and learn the \(g\)s, we can do very powerful things.

Fun fact: in practice, CNNs do _not_ implement convolution but instead **correlation** \[\tilde f(t) = \int_{\infty}^{\infty} f(t + t') \cdot g(t') dt'\]
for maths reasons (the maths requires the mirrored convolution, which is correlation).

**To build a CNN (3-top):**
1. each neuron only connects to 3 neurons of previous layer
	- image boundaries have to be resolved:
		- _cut off the offending neurons_
		- _zero padding_
		- _reflect boundaries_
2. weights are shared in each layer based on if the connection is left/middle/right
	- high response for the given pixel is a match

**Example:** LeNet architecture (Yann LeCun, 1998, 7 layers)
- first CNN to get MNIST accuracy > 99%
	- ~60000 images, 10 categories

![LeNet network diagram.](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/lenet.webp)

Comparing a CNN to a fully-connected (FC) network, the weight matrices look like this:

\[B_{\text{FC}} = \begin{pmatrix}
	\beta_{1,1} & \beta_{1,2} & \ldots & \beta_{1,6} \\
	\beta_{2,1} & \beta_{2,2} & \ldots & \beta_{2,6} \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
	\beta_{6,1} & \beta_{6,2} & \ldots & \beta_{1,6} \\
\end{pmatrix} \qquad B_{\text{CNN}} = \begin{pmatrix}
	w_2 & w_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	w_3 & w_2 & w_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & w_3 & w_2 & w_1 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & w_3 & w_2 & w_1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & w_3 & w_2 & w_1 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & w_3 & w_2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Here we handle the boundary with zeroes, but it can be done differently:
- for reflected, the leftmost \(w_3\) would be \(w_1 + w_3\) (along with the rightmost \(w_1\))
- for periodic, the rightmost top cell would not be \(0\) but \(w_3\) instead (+ some others)

Here we've seen one of the major operations, **convolution**, the other being **pooling:**
- reduces the image resolution, done by merging several input pixels into one output pixel
- typically reduces \(2 \times 2 \rightarrow 1\)
- not sliding anymore, _move by the window size_ instead (running window)
- usually either **average pooling** or **max pooling**

CNNs usually alternate between **convolution**, **non-linear layers** (ReLU), **pooling**, **dropout layers**, **batch normalization layers** and (towards the end of the network), **fully-connected layers** and **softmax layers**.

#### Receptive field of a neuron
- set of input pixels (from original image) that influence the value of a given neuron
- i.e. **maximum size of detectable patterns**
- RF of:
	- **one convolutional layer** is the **size of the kernel**
	- **sequence of convolutional layers** is **additive** (wrt. kernel radius)
	- **pooling** is **multiplicative** (wrt. pooling size)

#### Some history
- ImageNet (2008) ~14 mil. images, more than 1000 classes (224x224x3)
	- 1st public challenge (2010)
		- predict 5 guesses for the object class
		- correct if true label is within top 5 ("top-5 acc.")
		- _winner:_ non-linear SVM with hand-crafted features (28% top-5 error)
	- 2nd public challenge (2012)
		- _winner:_ CNN AlexNet (15.3% top-5 error)
	- 3rd public challenge (2014)
		- _winner:_ GoogLeNet -- inception architecture (6.7% top-5 error)
		- _runner-up:_ VGG -- upscaling of LeNet (7.3% top-5 error)
			- clean and popular (compared to winner, which was quite hacky)
			- used as a comparison metric for things like Midjourney/DALL-E (FID score)
			- making VGG bigger did not work (vanishing gradient problem) -- magnitude of gradient at the prompt decreases with the number of layers and the network doesn't converge
	- 2015: Residual Network (ResNets)
		- instead of learning a function per layer, learn weights wrt. the input layer
		- also skip connections as identity mappings, preventing vanishing gradients
		- reaches superhuman performance (humans 4/5%, ResNet 3.6%)
		- for top-1, we they had 25% error (nowadays ~10%)
	- nowadays, use two tricks:
		- train on _much larger datasets_ (up to 3B images)

#### Residual Networks (ResNet)
- base idea: use **skip connections** to avoid the **vanishing grandient** problem
- **stages** between pooling layers (image resolution _unchanged_ within the stage)
- **block** -- sequence of layers + one skip connection (bridges the block):
	- **batch normalization:** adjust mean and variance of pre-activations
		- bad when pre-activations have an arbitrary mean and variance (data should be within the intersting region of the activation function)
		- (\(\mu, \sigma\)) calculated for each batch 
- **layers** -- do the actual work

#### Training
- rule of thumb: **more data is better** (nowadays \(3 \times 10^9\) images)

##### Data augmentation
- apply transformations to the data that _keeps the classification unchanged_
- artificially increases the dataset
- popular augmentations:
	- **geometric** distortions:
		- mirroring, 90deg rotations
		- shearing % small angle rotations
		- crop regions & resize to original size
	- **image quality** distortions:
		- add noise -- Gaussian / salt & pepper (random 0/1 pixels)
		- mash out regions (set to gray)
	- **color** distortions:
		- transform to gray
		- transform color space (eg. LAB)
	- **other** distortions:
		- edge detection (human should still recognize it)
- hyperparameters:
	- **amount** of distortion
	- **number** of **simultaneous** distortions (\(\ge 2\) works good)

##### Self-supervised training
- use augmentation to avoid manual labelling
- **strategy (1):** use augmentation that can be **labeled automatically**
	- rotate by \(\alpha \implies\) predict \(\alpha\)
	- to solve this, network learns features that are useful for other tasks -- cut out the angle detection and use the reset of the network for feature detection
- **strategy (2): contrastive learning**
	- present augmented pairs; if it originated from the same image, features should be similar, else they should be different (ie. ignore data augmentations)
	- **SIMCLR** network -- famous for doing this
- **strategy (3): semi-supervised learning**
	- subset of the training set is labeled and rest is unlabeled
	- **student-teacher** approach:
		- train the teacher from the labeled and then use the teacher to label the unlabeled (preferably soft labels since it can make mistakes and might not be sure)
		- train the student with the original and the pseudolabels
		- experimentally, often the _student is better_ / has a _smaller network_

#### U-Net
- tasks in image analysis:
	1. **classification** (what we were talking about), 1 label per image
	2. **instance classification & segmentation**, 1 label + bounding box per instance
	3. **semantic segmentation**, 1 label per pixel (one-hot vector per pixel)
		- _less_ difficult than (2), since objects can be occluded by others
- U-Net solves (3)
- has the name because it looks like the letter U
- idea: **coarsening** to detect the semantics + **refinement** for pixel-precision

![U-net network structure.](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/u-net.webp)

- variation: [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) (2021)
	- designed here in Heidelberg!
	- previously, people designed new net for every task
	- observation: have _rules_ to design the network given the task (nn = no new)
	- won about 30 medical benchmark competitions

- U-net is a specific example of an **auto-encoder:**
	- takes in a \(D\)-dimensional data
	- then uses an **encoder** to convert to \(C\)-dimensional codes
	- lastly uses a **decoder** to convert back to the ~original data
	- since \(D \gg C\), this is lossy, but works really well
	- we want to minimize \((X - \mathrm{D}(\mathrm{E}(X)))^2\)

### Regression
- features \(X\), response \(Y\) real-valued scalar (or vector)
	- compared to classification where \(Y\) is discrete
- predict \(Y\) deterministically (\(Y = f_{\theta}(x)\)) or stochastically (\(y \sim p_\theta (Y \mid X)\))
- **functional representation lemma** (aka "reparametrization trick" / "noise outsourcing")
	- every conditional probability \(p(Y \mid X)\) can be expressed by a deterministic function & independent noise: \[y \sim p(Y \mid X = x) \equiv y = f_\theta(x, \varepsilon)\] with \(\varepsilon\) drawn from a distribution (usually Gaussian) independent from \(X\); eg. \[y \sim \mathcal N(Y, \mu(x), \Sigma(x)) \equiv y = \mu(x) + \Sigma(x)^{1/2} \cdot \varepsilon \qquad \varepsilon \sim N(0, \mathbf{I})\]
	- much more convenient since the distribution is fixed (not dependent on \(X\))

#### Linear regression
- easy case, just like linear regression
- assume that data is generated by some true (but unknown) generative process
	- in this case linear model with additive Gaussian noise, for simplicity assume \(y \in \mathbb{R}\)
\[Y_i = X_i \beta^* + b^* + \varepsilon_i \qquad \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)\] (i.e. variance is fixed but unknown)
- given \(\mathrm{TS} = \left\{(X_i Y_i)\right\}_{i = 1}^N\), find \(\hat \beta \approx \beta^*\) and \(\hat b = b^*\)
- important: assume that **only \(Y\) is noisy, not \(X\)** (other variant also exists)
- derive loss by maximum likelyhood principle and i.i.d. assumption: \[ \begin{aligned}
	\hat\beta, \hat b = \argmin_{\beta, b} p(\mathrm{TS}) &= \argmax_{\beta, b} \prod_{i = 1}^{N} p(Y_i \mid X_i) \\ 
	                                                      &= \argmin_{\beta, b} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} -\log p(Y_i \mid X_i) \\ 
	                                                      &= \argmin_{\beta, b} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} -\log N(Y_i \mid X_i \beta + b = \mu(x), \sigma^2) \\ 
	                                                      &= \argmin_{\beta, b} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} -\log \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{(Y_i - X_i \beta - b)^2}{\sigma^2}\right) \\ 
	                                                      &= \argmin_{\beta, b} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left[\cancel{\log \sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} + \cancel{\frac{1}{2}} \frac{\left(Y_i - X_i \beta - b\right)^2}{\cancel{\sigma^2}}\right] \\
	                                                      &= \boxed{\argmin_{\beta, b} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left(Y_i - X_i \beta - b\right)^2} \\ 
\end{aligned} \]

- squared loss \(\implies\) ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
- can be solved analytically: \[\frac{\partial \mathcal{loss}}{\partial b} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} -2 \left(Y_i - X_i \beta - b\right) \overset{!}{=} 0\\
    \Downarrow \\[0.5em]
	b = \underbrace{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} Y_i}_{\bar Y} - \underbrace{\left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} X_i\right)}_{\bar X}\beta\]

Written another way, we get \[\bar y = \bar X \beta + \hat b\] meaning that the regression always goes through the center of mass of TS, which allows us to first center the data (\(X - \bar X, Y - \bar Y\)), making the center of mass the origin and getting rid of \(\hat b\) (same as classification).

\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{loss}}{\partial \beta} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} -2 (Y_i - X_i \beta) X_i^T \overset{!}{=} 0 \\
\Downarrow \\[0.5em]
\boxed{\beta = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N} Y_i X_i^T}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N} X_i X_i^T}}
\]

Now we want to generalize to feature vectors -- \(X_i \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times D}\) (row vector) \(\implies\) rewrite the objective in matrix form (still assume centered data):

\[\hat \beta = \argmin_\beta \sum_{i = 1}^{N} (Y_i - X_i \beta)^2 = \argmin_\beta (Y - X \beta)^T (Y - X\beta)\]
where \(Y \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 1}, X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}\), so we get \[\frac{\partial \mathcal{loss}}{\partial \beta} = 2 (Y - X \beta) X^T \\
\Downarrow \\[0.5em]
\boxed{(X^T X) \hat \beta = X^T Y}\]

which are called the **normal equations** of the OLS problem, since \(\beta\) is the _normal of the regression plane_ and we can solve it as \[\boxed{\hat \beta = \underbrace{(X^T X)^{-1} X^T}_{\text{pseudoinverse}\ X^+} Y}\]

[Pseudoinverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse) is a generalization of the inverse for rectangular matrices:
- not a great way to calculate this -- expensive and also \(X^T X\) might be too degenerate
	- if at least one feature (column of \(X\)) can be expressed as a linear combination of other features, it will be entirely degenerate and OLS will have no solution
- **contition number \(\kappa(X) = ||X|| \cdot ||X^+||\)** measures this:
	- if \(\kappa(x) = 1 \implies X\) is nice (almost orthogonal features)
	- if \(\kappa(x) \gg 1 \implies X\) has almost redundant features, \(\hat \beta\) becomes inaccurate
	- if \(\kappa(x) = \infty \implies X\) has redundant features, \(\hat \beta\) doesn't exist
		- infinity arrises from the norm of \(X^+\) (division by \(0\))

We can instead solve OLS **by SVD**:
- every matrix \(X\) can be decomposed into \(X = U \Lambda V^T\) for
	- \(V \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}\) orthonormal matrix
	- \(\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}\) diagonal matrix
	- \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}\) quasi-orthonormal matrix
- using this we get \[\boxed{\beta = (V \Lambda^{-1} U^T) Y}\]
	- if \(k\) features are redundant, \(k\) eigenvalues are \(0\)
	- when we're doing \(\Lambda^{-1}\), this explores, set \(\Lambda' = \frac{1}{0} \mapsto 0\)
	- this gives us the minimum norm solution of the degenrate OLS problem
- condition number for SVD is \(\kappa(X) = \frac{\max \lambda}{\min \lambda}\)
- advantage: numerically very stable, even when \(X\) is almost degenerate
- disadvantage: very complicated algorithm (500 LOC of Fortran); nowadays this is ok

Third solution: **QR decomposition**
- much easier than SVD, reasonably robust for bad data
- uses a different decomposition \(X = Q \cdot R\) for
	- \(Q \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}\) orthonormal
	- \(R \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}\) upper triangular
- using this, we get \[\boxed{\hat \beta R^{-1} Q^T Y} \quad \text{or alternatively} \quad \boxed{R \hat\beta = Q^T Y}\] which can be solved by a simple algorithm -- \(R\) is upper triangular so we can use substitution from the last row of \(R \hat\beta\) upward

_What do we do if \(N\) and \(D\) are very big?_
- in theory, we're screwed (SVD complexity \(\mathcal{O}(N \times D^2)\))
- in practice, big \(X\) matrices usually have special structure which we can exploit
	- \(X\) sparse -- alg. only deals with the non-zero elements
	- \(X\) is a convolution -- even more strict
- we don't access \(X\) directly, but via _subroutines_
	- **vector-matrix product** \(b^T X \implies \mathtt{vector\_times\_X}(b)\)
	- **matrix-vector product** \(Xa \implies \mathtt{X\_times\_vector}(a)\)
	- all the tricks to exploit the special strucure of \(X\) hidden here:

##### LSQR
1. trick: only use the subroutines to exploit the structure
2. trick: rearrange the computation such that only 2 rows or columns of the result matrices are needed simultaneously (in memory)

- LSQR decomposition is \(X = U \cdot B \cdot V^T\) where
	- \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}\) is orthonormal
	- \(B \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}\) is upper bi-diagonal
		- diagonal + one more diagonal above are non-zero, the rest is zero
	- \(V \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}\) is orthonormal
- implemented as `scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr` in Python (or new and improved `lsmr`)
	- arguments are sparse matrices

_The lecture here has an interlude into computer tomography, which can be solved using least-squares. Most of it is explained in [homework 4](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/hw4.pdf) so I'm not going to repeat it here._

##### Least Squares v2.0
What do we do when noise variance is not constant?
- i.e. we change the generative model into \[Y_i = X_i \beta^* \underbrace{(+ b)}_{\text{0}} + \varepsilon_i \qquad \varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma_i^2)\]
- data still independent but no longer identically distributed
- we use \(\theta\) since we want to learn both \(\beta\) and \(\sigma\)

\[ \begin{aligned}
	\theta = \argmax_\theta p(\mathrm{TS}) &= \argmax_\theta \prod_{i = 1}^{N} p_i(Y_i \mid X_i) \\
	&= \argmin_\theta \sum_{i = 1}^{N} - \log p_i(Y_i \mid X_i) \\
	&= \argmin_\theta \sum_{i = 1}^{N} - \log N(Y_i - X_i \beta \mid 0, \sigma_i^2) \\
	&= \argmin_\theta \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left[-\log \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_i^2}} + \frac{\left(Y_i - X_i \beta\right)^2}{2 \sigma_i^2} \right] \\
	&= \boxed{\argmin_\theta \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left[\cancel{\frac{1}{2}}\log \sigma_i^2 - \cancel{\frac{1}{2}} \frac{\left(Y_i - X_i \beta\right)^2}{\sigma_i^2} \right]}
\end{aligned} \]

Here we distinguish multiple cases:
1. **OLS** (all \(\sigma\)s are the same) -- we can simplify further and get stuff from lectures above
2. **weighted LS** (\(\sigma_i\) are known) -- then \[\argmin_\beta \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \frac{(Y_i - X_i \beta)^2}{\sigma_i^2}\]
	- the \(\sigma\)s act as weights for the residuals
	- we can rewrite in matrix notation (\(\sigma\)s as a diagonal) and get \[\hat \beta = \argmin_\beta (Y - X \beta)^T \Sigma^{-1} (Y - X \beta)\]
	- this can be solved by setting the derivative to zero and we get a **weighted pseudo-inverse** \[\boxed{\hat \beta = \left(X^T \Sigma^{-1} X\right)^{-1} X^T \Sigma^{-1} Y}\]
3. **iteratively reweighed LS** (\(\sigma_i\) are not constant and unknown) -- learn the \(\sigma\)s jointly with \(\beta\))
	- \(\sigma_i\) is **unsupervised**, \(\beta\) is **supervised** -- gives rise to interesting algorithms
	- the problem can be formulated as \[\argmin_\theta \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left[\log \sigma_i^2 - \frac{\left(Y_i - X_i \beta\right)^2}{\sigma_i^2} \right]\] usually called David-Sebastian score or hetero-scedastic loss
	- if \((Y_i - X_i \beta)^2\) is big \(\implies\) increase \(\sigma_i\) to make the loss smaller, but we pay the penalty of \(\log \sigma_i^2\) for big \(\sigma\)s (optimal solution selects \(\sigma_i^2\) for the best trade-off)

#### Alternating optimization
- we want to solve IRLS by alternating learning \(\beta\) and \(\sigma\)
- two groups of parameters \(\theta = \left[\theta_1, \theta_2\right]\) (here \(\theta_1 = \beta, \theta_2 = \left\{\sigma_i^2\right\}_{i = 1}^N\))
- main idea: optimize \(\theta_1\) while keeping \(\theta_2\) fixed (and vice versa)

1. define initial guess for \(\theta_2^{(0)}\)
2. for \(t = 1, \ldots, T\) (or until convergence)
	- optimize \(\theta_1^{(t)}\), keeping \(\theta_2^{(t - 1)}\) fixed
	- optimize \(\theta_2^{(t)}\), keeping \(\theta_1^{(t)}\) fixed

- **benefit:** individual optimization problems are much easier (can have an analytic solution)
- **drawback:** usually doesn't converge to the global optimum

To solve IRLS using this method, we do the following

1. define initial guess as \(\tau_i = 1\) (\(\tau_i = \sigma_i^2\)
2. for \(t = 1, \ldots, T\) (or until convergence)
	- obtain \(\beta^{(t)}\) via **weighted least squares** (since \(\sigma\)s are known and fixed)
	- since \(\beta\) is fixed, we get \[\left\{\tau_i^{(t)}\right\} = \argmin_{\left\{\tau_i\right\}} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \frac{Y_i - X_i \beta^{(t)}}{\tau_i} + \log \tau_i\] which we can solve by setting the derivative to \(0\) and obtain \[\boxed{\tau_i^{(t)} = (Y_i - X_i \beta^{(t)})^2}\] i.e. _standard derivations are equal to the magnitude of the error_

How many iterations are required?
- in theory (with infinite accuracy) **two** iterations are sufficient
- in practice **few** iterations are sufficient (kinda cool, no?)

#### Regularized regression
- even if we don't have a unique solution, we can select the "best" one
- we already saw penalties \(||\beta^2||\) in SVM and \(\log \sigma_i^2\) in IRLS
- we need regularization in two cases
	1. more features than observations (\(D > N\))
	2. condition of matrix \(X\) is bad (\(\kappa(X) \gg 1\))o
		- features are almost redundant, \(\hat \beta\) tends to overfit
		- assume feature \(j\) and \(j'\) are identical in TS (\(X_j = X_{j'}\))
		- if \(\hat \beta\) is a solution, so it \(\hat \beta'\) with \(\hat \beta_j' = \hat \beta_j' + \gamma\) and \(\hat \beta_j' = \hat \beta_j' - \gamma\)
		- this also works for very large \(\gamma\), which is a problem since the features might be different in test instances (i.e. overfitting)
		- _in practice, usually more features and only near cancelation_

##### Ridge regression
Uses a standard regularization idea to penalize \(\beta_j\) with large magnitude (or squared magnitude):

\[\hat \beta = \argmin_\beta (Y - X\beta)^T (Y - X\beta) \quad s.t. \quad ||\beta^2|| \le t\]
- if constraint doesn't activate after we solve, we're chilling
- otherwise add the constraint as a **Lagrange multiplier** (same as SVM)

\[\hat \beta_{RR} = \argmin_\beta (Y - X\beta)^T (Y - X\beta) + \tau ||\beta^2||\]

Setting the derivative to zero, we obtain the **regularized pseudo-inverse** \[\hat \beta_{RR} = (X^T X + \tau \mathbb{I})^{-1} X^T Y\]

- data should ideally be **standardized** (zero mean, unit variance) so we shrink \(\tau\) equally

Alternative solution via **augmented feature matrix** -- reduces to OLS by modifying \(X\) and \(Y\) to be \[\tilde X = \begin{pmatrix}
	& X & \\
	& & \\
	\sqrt{\tau} & & \\
	& \ddots & \\
	& & \sqrt{\tau} \\
\end{pmatrix} \qquad \tilde Y = \begin{pmatrix}
	Y \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}\]
- by expanding OLS, we can see this is equivalent to original loss

Another alternative solution is via **SVD**.

##### Bias-variance trade-off
When using regularization, we'd like to know two things:
1. what's the price that we pay for regularization?
2. how to choose \(\tau\) to minimize disadvantages

Both solved via **bias-variance trade-off**: we have \(M\) teams working on the same problem, each with their own \(\mathrm{TS}\):
- how much will the results differ between teams?
- what happens when \(M \rightarrow \infty\)?

Definitions:
- \(\beta^*\): weights of the true generative process \(Y^* = X \beta^* + \varepsilon\)
- \(\hat \beta_m\): results of team \(m\)
- \(\mathbb{E}_m [\hat \beta_m] \approx \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m = 1}^{M} \hat \beta_m\): average result of all teams
- \(\mathrm{Cov(\hat \beta_m}) = \mathbb{E}_m \left[\left(\hat \beta_m - \mathbb{E}[\hat \beta_m]\right)\left(\hat \beta_m - \mathbb{E}[\hat \beta_m]\right)^T\right] \): 
- \(\mathrm{bias} = \beta^* - \mathbb{E}_m [\hat \beta_m]\): systematic error after combining team results

Now we'll measure the quality of outcomes by \[
\begin{aligned}

Useful, because we can see that \(\tau\) (regularization) has **opposite effects** on **bias** and **variance** -- "bias-variance trade-off"
- \(\tau = 0 \ldots\) high variance (teams disagree) but zero bias
- \(\tau = \infty \ldots\) all teams same solution, but it's \(0\)
- \(\tau > 0 \ldots\) agreement between teams increases but so does bias (trade-off)

![Bias-variance tradeoffs.](/assets/introduction-to-machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoffs.webp)

- **best trade-off:** all error sources have roughly same magnitude
	- check via cross-validation (or validation set)
- **bad:** only address a single error source (diminishing returns)

##### Other regularization terms
- **Ridge regression**: regularization term \[||\beta||_2 = \sum_{i = 1}^{D} \beta_j^2 \le t\]
- **Feature selection**: \[||\beta||_0 = \sum_{i = 1}^{D} \mathbb{1}[\beta_j \neq 0] \le t\]
	- count how many features are _active_
	- _advantage:_ reduce the number of measurements
	- _disadvantage:_ finding the optimal feature set is NP-hard (but in practice a simple greedy algorithm like OMP is often good enough)
- **LASSO regression**: \[||\beta||_1 = \sum_{i = 1}^{D} |\beta_j| \le t\]
	- stands for Last Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator
	- also performs feature selection when \(t\) is small enough
	- _advantage:_
		- still a convex optimization problem \(\implies\) unique solution
		- solution often sparse (many \(\beta_j = 0\)) \(\implies\) feature selection
	- _disadvantage:_
		- bias (bias-variance trade-off)
		- active set may not be as sparse as in \(L_0\) optimization
	- many algorithms (in the field of linear optimization)
		- gradient descent
		- LARS (Least Angle RegreSsion) algorithm -- almost the same as OMP, but at the beginning of each iteration, checks if the matrix is redundant (and removes weakest factors until it isn't); doesn't happen too often though

**Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)**
- approximately (local optimum) solves feature selection, i.e. \[\hat \beta = \argmin_\beta \sum_{i = 1}^{N} (Y_i^* - X_i \beta)^2 \quad \text{s.t.} ||\beta_0|| \le t\]

1. initialization: set of active features\(A^{(0)} = \emptyset\)
2. for \(\tau = 1, \ldots, t\) (max. number of features)
	- compute residual of current guess \(R = Y^* - X \beta^{(\tau - 1)}\)
	- find best inactive feature \(j^{(\tau)} = \argmax_{j \not\in A^{(\tau - 1)}} |X_j^T R|\)
		- if the direction of the new feature is similar to the residual, it improves the solution by a lot
		- if it's orthogonal then it can't do much
	- add new feature to active set \(A^{(\tau)} = A^{(\tau - 1)} \cup \left\{j^{(\tau)}\right\}\)
	- compute new guess by solving OLS only with active features

#### Non-linear regression
- keep squared loss \(\implies \hat \theta = \argmin_\theta \sum_{i = 1}^{N } \left(Y_i^* - f_\theta (X_i)^2\right)\)
	- \(f_\theta(X) = X \beta \implies\) linear regression
	- \(f_\theta(X)\) neural network with parameters \(\theta\)
- true generative process \(Y_i^* = f_{\theta^*} (X_i) + \varepsilon_i \quad \varepsilon_i ~ N(0, \sigma^2)\)

**Two general approaches:**
1. transform features such that we can run linear regression (and use OLS)
	- hand-crafted
	- learned (first layer of a NN learns the parameters) - same as classification, except
		- squared loss (instead of cross-entropy)
		- last layers is linear (no activation)
2. design algorithms to solve non-linear least squares
	- if \(\dim(\theta)\) is not very high (\(\mathcal{O}(100)\)), use **Levenberg-Markquart**
	- **regression trees** and forests / **Gaussian processes**
		- good results if \(\mathrm{TS}\) is small (so NN cannot be trained)

##### Piecewise constant approximation
- idea: approximate a function using _piecewise constant function_
- in theory, we can get an _arbitrarily good approximation_

How to choose bins?
- classical: **grid** (great for \(D = 1, 2\), rather expensive for \(D \ge 3\))
- better: define bins **adaptively** (bin size based on the number of datapoints)
	1. method: **\(k\)-means** (defines bins by nearest-neighbour computation)
	2. method: **recursive subdivision**
