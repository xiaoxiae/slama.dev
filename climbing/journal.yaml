  note: A pretty terrible session (despite sending a new black). It was really no
    wonder since I'm sick as of writing this entry (6/11/2022). I'll take a few days
    of rest, recover and hopefully come back stronger :).

  note: Fun session back! The new routes were quite neat, I did a few of the red ones
    and made really good progress on one of the blacks (got all of the moves down),
    so it will hopefully go down next session, along with the remaining reds :).

  note: Pretty decent session. I did the new reds (along with some from the hangar
    that I haven't been to yet) and the black that I mentioned two sessions ago. I
    figured out a totally different beta though so it was like climbing a totally
    new route (will hopefully get it on video next time). Also messed around a bit
    with some fun custom routes (see video).

  note: A pretty strong session! I did the new black in two parts (will link next
    time) and managed to do all of the new reds. Also, I did both of the blacks from
    the previous setting (one repeat and one new), so I honestly can't complain :).

    then spent rest of it just messing around on custom boulders.

  note: Yet again a strong session. I sent all of the new hard boulders -- including
    a new black -- but I didn't use the intended beta, which made it easier. I tried
    the intended beta and fell from the top so I'm pretty happy :).

  note: Had a lot of fun with the new boulders. Managed to do all but one black where
    I fell from the top :(. I got the moves completely down though so I'm pretty confident
    that I can do it next session.

    also a 7c and a 7c+, achieving my end-of-the-year goal with style. Oh and the
    black did go down this session :).

  note: Fun session! The new black went down with quite a neat beta and I managed
    to send the red in the roof while also making good progress on the other red in
    the roof (which is more like black).

  note: A very long but fun session. I did all of the new routes (besides the red
    in the roof which I'll do next time when I'm fresh) and then messed around on
    a bunch of custom problems. I also helped with setting of today's christmas boulder
    problem, which I think turned out very well :).

  note: New boulders were nice -- fun reds and a very hard black which I think I can
    do but will take me a little bit :). Also there were burgers and although they
    were vegan, they tasted pretty good!
