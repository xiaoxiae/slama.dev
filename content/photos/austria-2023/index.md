{{< image_section caption="<strong>Summit attempt 2:</strong> success! The conditions were amazing and, even despite those, the top was extremely sketchy (last 30 minutes were essentially soft climbing on snow). We made it back in like 3 hours of running, which was pretty exciting and a completely different mood to the first attempt." >}}
