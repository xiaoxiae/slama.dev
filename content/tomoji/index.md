Hey! <span class="tomoji">👉</span>

These <span class="tomoji">🤨</span> are actual emojis (**[Tomoji](https://tomoji.slama.dev/)s**, since that's me), created from my face.
They were created by taking pictures <span class="tomoji">🤳</span> and running them through a small [MediaPipe](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/image_segmenter) face segmentation network. The bitmap font was constructed using [CBDT/CBLC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cbdt) and [OpenType-SVG](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/svg) font tables.

I [**made an interactive website**](https://tomoji.slama.dev/) that allows you to do the same (as well as host it there), since I find this really, really funny.
This post serves as a public service announcement to go try it out -- while the default emojis are cute, your face, dear reader, is cuter.

**Go make a font! <span class="tomoji">😀</span>**
