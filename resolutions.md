Notes regarding the resolutions, so I don't forget.

Books:

- The Soul of a New Machine (it was also comfy).
- The Lies of Locke Lamora
- Red Seas Under Red Skies
- The Republic of Thieves
- Rythm of War (to refresh)
- Wind and Truth (banger)
- Ball Lightning (amazing!!!)
- Isles of the Emberdark (also amazing!!!)
- Lost Metal (comfy)
- Mistborn 1 - The Final Empire (comfy)
- Isles of the Emberdark (had to do it)
- Skyward (still not into this Brandon Sanderson series)
- Starsight (still ass, not reading the rest)
