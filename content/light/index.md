## Project Light

_I'm trying to do some fantasy writing.
It sucks right now, I'll unhide this when it doesn't, so read only if you truly have nothing better to do and don't mind cringing._

### Chapter I: The Pulse-claw

#### The Clearing

<span class="drop-cap">K</span>hast moved as fast as light would allow.
His frantic steps crushed the reflective leaves blanketing the forest floor, scattering patches of light from the setting sun onto the surrounding trees.

Sparing a glance behind, he could see the light pulses from within the forest growing brighter.
He willed himself to move faster, but the sun could not be reasoned with -- all he could do was walk lethargically towards the clearing in the distance and pray.

By the time he reached it, the sun was nearing the end of its shuffling phase.
He had an hour, perhaps less, to make it home -- falling asleep in the forest would mean death.
He quickly inspected the rope, made sure his knife was firmly attached to his belt and steeled himself for what was about to come.

With a burst of bright light, the pulse-claw appeared on the other side of the clearing.
The shining lines that streaked its skin emitted rhythmic pulses of flashing light, accompanied by sudden head movements as it took in the surroundings.
Its sharp claws marked the creature's other specialty, scratching the stone it landed on and sounding a reminder that this fight could be over in one quick swipe.
From the shorter delay between the flashes, Khast could tell that this specimen was younger, making it faster and more dangerous, but perhaps more easily deceived.

As the light from the flashes hit Khast, his body felt, for a brief moment, ready and alert.
While the meager amount of light from the setting sun kept his senses dull, each flash from the pulse-claw brought him back to reality and to the gravity of the situation.
His reflexes were nowhere near fast enough to react to the creature's actions, but that is all he would get, and he prayed that it was all that he would need.

The pulse-claw began to close the distance in a series of alternating dashes and pauses, accentuating its movement by blinding flashes of white light.
The trees around responded in kind, sending the light rays through its reflective leaves around the clearing, cascading deeper into the forest and sending a warning to the forest's inhabitants.
The creature made little sound as it moved, as the light conveyed all necessary information.

With every movement, Khast's muscles tensed with fear and anticipation.
Being only able to move in concert with the much faster and deadly predator meant that escape was out of the question.
The only thing he could do was wait for the creature to get closer and hope that his plan worked.

Nearing ten paces, the creature's dashes became shorter and more measured, as it prepared for a final burst to capture its prey.

A loud growl.

One last pulse.

*Now*, Khast thought, as he slid his knife across the tensioned rope, closed his eyes and stepped aside.
With a loud snap, the rope gave way and shot up, revealing a reflective shield suspended in the branches above the pulse-claw.
As the creature pounced, the noise drew its attention upward, reflecting a concentrated wave of light back into its eyes.

Khast stabbed.

The knife, driven by the creature's light and its brief disorientation, found its mark, piercing the creature's neck and severing the main artery.
With a quick flash and a high whine, the creature retreated from Khast, but the damage had been done.
Gushing blood from the wound, it made a few shuddering movements and pulses as it attempted to flee, but with each dimming pulse its moves grew lethargic, until it eventually slumped down in the middle of the clearing and stilled.

Khast's knife clattered to the floor, his senses immediately dulling.
Staring at the pulse-claw's lifeless body in sheer disbelief, he couldn't believe that his plan had actually worked.

Despite the fatigue, he willed himself to focus, picked up the knife and began the gruesome work of dissecting the body.
Extracting the vitals and placing them into the vials he had prepared earlier in the day, he knew that getting back to the village in time was going to be close.

Getting up with mounting slowness, he began the shuffle towards Amber, the place he hoped to save, with the knowledge he now carried on his back.
A thirty-minute walk with this much light was likely not going to be enough, but he had to try.
Not for him, but for them.

It was going to be close.

*Sun sank.*

He could see the gates in the distance.

*Twilight.*

Just one more st...

*Darkness.*

#### Amber

Khast woke up.

Slowly opening his eyes, he found himself in a room with a bed.
Morning light shone though the sun reflector and bathed the room in warm light as he took in his surroundings.

It was clear that he was in one of the village's many medical tents, as 

As he began to rise, pain flared up immediately from his right leg and he was forced to collapse back onto the bed.

"Don't move," Lira said as she rushed to the side of his bed.

"Shir found you outside of the city gates, bleeding badly."
