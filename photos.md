Below are collections of photos that I've taken -- some are meant to be just pretty, others depict places that I've seen and things that I've done.
All of them had been compressed (quite aggressively) to be web-usable; **if you'd like to see the originals, simply click on the photos** (JS required).

I also try to be active on **[Instagram <i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i>](https://www.instagram.com/tomas.slama/)**, so feel free to give me a follow if you like the photos! 🙂

_All of the photos are licensed under **[CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)**, so kindly respect it if you plan on using any of them for uses other than personal._
