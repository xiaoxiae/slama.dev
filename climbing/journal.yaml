    that I haven't been to yet) and the black that I mentioned two sessions ago. I
    figured out a totally different beta though so it was like climbing a totally
    new route (will hopefully get it on video next time). Also messed around a bit
    with some fun custom routes (see video).

  note: Spent a whole session on Perkeo. At the beginning, I couldn't do any of the
    moves. By the end, I had some pretty good links and feel very optimistic about
    sending (that could come crumbling down very quick). I also did Gerdina + Gerdina
    Links a few more times to further practice the topouts.
