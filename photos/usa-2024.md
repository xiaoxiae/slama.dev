<figcaption><strong>Day 4:</strong> First: farm. Also went to the Brandywine art gallery (nice local paintings) and the Downington climbing gym ‚Äì the locals had a lot of fun watching me climb with rental shoes. </figcaption>

<figcaption><strong>Day 5:</strong> Saw my old robotics team compete (1391 FIRST Robotics). The field broke down around 1:30 and didn't start up again for a while so I left for a walk. Went for drinks in the evening for Saint Patrick's.</figcaption>

<figcaption><strong>Day 6:</strong> Back to Philly with Eli≈°ka, then rollerskating with Dylan and Alycia. First time, wasn't so bad!</figcaption>

<figcaption><strong>Day 7:</strong> Back to Philly yet again, this time to see Daelan (the person I built the robot with). Then we went back to where we were staying and later back to Philly to see some friends because I'm a fucking idiot and don't know geography.</figcaption>

<figcaption><strong>Day 8:</strong> Drive to Boston. 10/10 AirBnB, had Smokey the cat.</figcaption>

<figcaption><strong>Day 10:</strong> Drive to New York (or, well, Newark where we're staying). The AirBnB was truly a horror experience, but we prevail. Sightseeing New York from Jersey City (Hoboken).</figcaption>
