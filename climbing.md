## [Boulderhaus](https://www.boulderhaus.net/), Heidelberg
Since moving to Heidelberg for my Master's degree, Boulderhaus is the gym that I frequent.
The setting is quite old-school (compared to the walls in Prague that I frequented), mostly difficult moves and hard positions as opposed to dynamics.

_Note that since Germany's private and public filming laws are quite strict, each of the videos from Boulderhaus were ran through a [face blur software](https://github.com/ORB-HD/deface). I realize that the chance of someone having a problem with them walking by in one of my videos is slim, but I'd rather not risk it._

## Kilter board
The Kilter board has been a bit of an obsession of mine ever since moving to Heidelberg.
The holds are much more pleasant compared to other boards (like Moonboard) and the app is quite simple to use.

Here are links to sections with all sends given certain grades, along with the number of videos:

## [Smíchoff](https://www.lezeckecentrum.cz/cs/), Prague
Smíchoff was the only gym in Prague that I frequented, since it is (in my opinion) the best one, so the vast majority of the clips in previous entries are going to be from here.
People are nice, prices are student-friendly and boulders are frequently changed, so it's a perfect place to be.

## Diary
The following contains my climbing diary -- how many new/old boulders have I done (and links to them). It also serves as a convenient way to view the most recently sent boulders.

Since there there are some other walls that I visit from time to time (mostly thanks to some of my friends), here is the list of icons that you might see in the journal entries:
