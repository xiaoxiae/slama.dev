If you've found any of {`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.aws/credentials`, `.htaccess`, `web.config`, `config.php`, `admin/config.php`, `wp-config.php`, `settings.py`, `config/database.yml`, `app/config/database.yml`}, rest assured that these are **fake** and **auto-generated** every time the website builds.
Hopefully I have wasted at least some time of people looking to break into my server (which I bet I have, judging by the Nginx logs).

If you're
- here to report one such file, I sincerely **thank you** for being a good person and I hope that I haven't wasted too much of your time ️❤️,
- here to report something else,  please contact [tomas@slama.dev](mailto:tomas@slama.dev),
- here after trying unsuccessfully to use the fake credentials, go fuck yourself 🖕.
