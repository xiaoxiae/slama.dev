I bet you didn't expect a post about politics on here.

I've been thinking for quite a while to start writing about my opinions on issues like these for a while, but thought that this website is not the place.
Thinking it over, however, I don't see a better one -- social media has become a cesspool oriented towards punchy one-liners instead of researched opinions, so writing a post about a topic that I feel strongly about is probably the way to go.

Since **I am not a US citizen,** this post serves mostly as a plea toward my US readers (and anyone else who stumbles upon it) -- you might not realize this, but your influence of other countries around the world is significant, so having a competent non-pro-Russia leader would be nice.

_The post is separated into a few sections, each of which are an argument for why nobody should be voting for Trump.
It will be updated with new information up until the election, so please let me know if I got something wrong or if something should be included._

Let's get into it.


### Trump **lead an insurrection**

Trump has, without a doubt, **attempted to coup the government,** in a scheme that culminated in the January 6th Capitol riots.
What is absolutely mind-melting is that if you ask most people what happened, they will respond with something akin to this:

{: .half-visible}
> Trump told the supporters that they should march peacefully. Then there were some bad people that turned it into a riot. Oh and the protesters were lead into the capitol by the police. Also, Ray Epps...

Let's speak facts.

The [actual plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot), outlined by [John Eastman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eastman) (likely to disbarred for this) in the [Eastman Memos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastman_memos) and facilitated mainly by [Rudy Giuliani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani) (actually disbarred for this) paints a very different picture.

The central idea was to submit [**fake slates of electors**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot)[^fake] for 7 states where Trump lost, _along with the real ones_, which were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin (states where Biden won only by a narrow margin).
The plan hinged on [Mike Pence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence) going along with this when counting the elector votes (could have gone many different ways, each resulting in Trump's re-election[^memo]).

[^memo]: Taken directly from he [Eastman Memos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastman_memos):
    - VP Pence, presiding over the joint session, begins to open and count the ballots.
    - When he gets to Arizona, he announces that he has **multiple slates of electors,** and so is going to defer decision on that until finishing the other States.
    - At the end, he announces that because of the ongoing disputes in the 7 States, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those States. That means the total number of "electors appointed" – the language of the 12th Amendment – is 454. A "majority of the electors appointed" would therefore be 228. There are at this point 232 votes for Trump, 222 votes for Biden. **Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected.**
    - Howls, of course, from the Democrats, who now claim, contrary to Tribe's prior position, that 270 is required. So Pence says, fine. Pursuant to the 12th Amendment, no candidate has achieved the necessary majority. That sends the matter to the House, where “the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote ..." Republicans currently control 26 of the state delegations, the bare majority needed to win that vote. **President Trump is re-elected there as well.**


[^fake]: [Here is one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NgLQxMV9c) that shows a group attempting to enter the Michigan Capitol and being denied access, since the official electors have already entered. [These people have been charged and are felons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_prosecution_of_fake_electors)

Trump knew about this, mentioning the plot many times in his [Jan 6th speech](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial):

{: .half-visible}
> We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.

Standing in the crowd, you would probably think... what does that mean?

{: .half-visible}
> And I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so.
> Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.

Huh? What does Mike Pence have to do? Isn't his role ceremonial?

{: .half-visible}
> All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people.

Wait, what? He can really do that?

Luckily, and despite [repeatedly being pressured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election#More_pressure_on_Pence) both before and during January 6th by both Trump and his lawyers, since Mike Pence is not a disgusting piece of filth, refused to go along with this, resulting in the coup attempt to ultimately fail.

Note that this is only the most egregious part of the scheme -- I suggest you read through the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election) to get a quick summary as well as the **full [Jan 6th indictment](https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump_23_cr_257.pdf)** to get the full scope.

Here are some quick things to note to conclude this section:
- [**the rioters broke into the capitol first**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWJVMoe7OY0) -- the footage of them being lead by the police was them being lead to areas where they couldn't harm the congresspeople (remember, that's why they broke inside -- to _stop the vote,_ which was being held inside)
- [**all of Trump's allegations of fake/incorrect votes were ruled to be false**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election#Election_audits) -- audits were performed in most of the states, **many by Trump-appointed conservative judges**, and found virtually[^audits] no issues.
- **[Trump does not deny any of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXQ43yyJvgs)** -- his response was to have is lawyers go to the supreme court and ask for absolute criminal immunity for official acts, which he received due to the current 6/3 republican/democrat split.

[^audits]: No issues in some states, a tiny number of duplicate/deceased votes in others (at most 100 for a state with ~4 million ballots, i.e. an error of at most **0.0025%**).


### Trump **coerced Ukraine**
If you think that performing a coup was bad enough, how about **coercing other nations by withholding military funding to help uncover dirt on your political rivals?**

In a now-unclassified [phone conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/assets/do-not-vote-trump-2024/zelenskyy-call.pdf), Trump abused his power to coerce Zelenskyy to cooperate with his personal lawyers and uncover damaging information of **Biden,** who was the 2020 democratic party candidate.

Trump did this by **personally blocking a congressionally-mandated $400 million military package**, hoping it would force Ukraine to cooperate with his demands, which sparked his [first impeachment trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump).
This is supported by the already mentioned [phone conversation transcript](/assets/do-not-vote-trump-2024/zelenskyy-call.pdf), which was followed hours later by [emails to Pentagon](https://www.justsecurity.org/67863/exclusive-unredacted-ukraine-documents-reveal-extent-of-pentagons-legal-concerns/) advising the **quiet** suspension of the funds:

> Based on guidance I have received and in light of the Administration’s plan to review assistance to Ukraine, including the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, please hold off on any additional DOD obligations of these funds, pending direction from that process. I understand that DOD will continue its planning and casework during this period and that this brief pause in obligations will not preclude DOD’s timely execution of the final policy direction.
>
> We intend to formalize the pause with an apportionment footnote to be provided later today.
>
> **Given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping that information closely held to those who need to know to execute the direction. Please let me know if you have any questions.**

and additionally by the [transcript of William Taylor's testimony](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/06/us/politics/william-taylor-ukraine-transcript.html) (starting at page 17), who was a top US diplomat in Ukraine during this time and testified under oath that both aid and white house meetings were conditioned under cooperation with the investigations.

Oh, and he also did similar things publicly with [Australia](https://archive.ph/20191003014641/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/trump-australia-barr-mueller.html) and [China](https://archive.today/20191003161404/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/us/politics/trump-china-bidens.html) 🙂.


### Trump **is a rapist**

Trump's relationship with women is revloting: Trump

- **[is a rapist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/),** being found liable for sexual assault that would be commonly understood as rape, and is also currently being [sued for defamation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/07/11/carroll-trump-defamation-justice-department-liability/?itid=lk_inline_manual_27) due to his remarks while president[^sc]:
    > Number one, she’s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?
    {: .half-visible}

- **[entered beauty peagant dressing rooms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGpVreCqNLo)** while the girls were changing:
    > Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I'll go backstage and everyone's getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. You know, I'm inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good. [...] You know, the dresses. 'Is everyone okay?' You know, they're standing there with no clothes. 'Is everybody okay?' And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. But no, I've been very good.
    {: .half-visible}

- **[abused his position of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape)** to perform unwanted sexual acts:
    > I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.
    {: .half-visible}

- has **[exceedingly creepy remarks about his daughter](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-ivanka-trump-creepiest-most-unsettling-comments-a-roundup-a7353876.html)**:
    > If she wasn't my daughter, you know, I'd date her.
    >
    > My daughter, Ivanka. She’s 6 feet tall, she’s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model—a tremendous amount.
    >
    > Yeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father...
    {: .half-visible}

[^sc]: "She's not my type" is a wild thing to say to rape alegations.

The fact that he was found to have raped someone is the least of the problems outlined should hopefully give you a good idea of who this person is, and that voting for him is unjustifiable.


### Trump **eats burgers without pickles**

Ignore the other stuff, this is one is fucked up.

Quoting a [DailyMeal article](https://www.thedailymeal.com/entertain/donald-trump-mcdonalds-order):

{: .half-visible}
> According to a profile on the Trump White House in Politico, he reportedly asked the White House kitchen to cook him up a McDonald's-style meal. But not any meal! He wanted a quarter-pounder with cheese with extra ketchup and no pickles. For dessert, he wanted one of the fast food chain's signature fried apple pies.

This man is a psychopath and should be jailed immediately.
