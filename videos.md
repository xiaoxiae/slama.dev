I occasionally create videos about math/computer science that I put up on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IaBSHmisYbiYlv32EeNkQ).
They are created mainly using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) and their source code can be [found here](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/videos).

This page contains a list of all of the released ones (by category and date).
