I occasionally create videos about math/computer science that I put up on my **[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IaBSHmisYbiYlv32EeNkQ)**.
They are created mainly using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) and their source code can be [found here](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/videos).

Unfortunately, I don't have much time these days to create videos by myself.
Fortunately, I have other friends over on the **[Polylog YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PolylogCS)** with a similar issue, and creating videos together is a much more manageable task, so I will likely be working on videos on the Polylog channel for the foreseeable future.
