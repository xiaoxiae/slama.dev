_This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use this website and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you._

I don't use your personal data. I mean... why would I? This is a personal blog, what would I even do with it? However, since all cool modern websites have them, I must too, so here is a filled-in template.

## Definitions
Since I don't really have anything to talk about in this section but the template includes it, here are some definitions that I think are useful. Feel free to thank me later.

For the purposes of this privacy policy:

{: .spaced-list}
- the function \(f\) has a **total differential** in the point \(\mathbf{a}\), if there exists a continuous function \(\mu\) in the neighbourhood of \(U\) of the point \(\mathbf{o} \in \mathbb{R}^n\), such that \(\mu(\mathbf{o}) = 0\), and numbers \(A_1, \ldots, A_n\), for which \[f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{h}) - f(\mathbf{a}) = \sum_{k - 1}^{n} A_k h_k + || \mathbf{h} || \mu(\mathbf{h})\]
- the **Tutte polynomial** of a multigraph \(G = (V, E)\) is a polynomial of \(x, y\) defined as \[T_G(x, y) = \sum_{F \subseteq E} (x - 1)^{r(E) - r(F)} \cdot (y - 1)^{n(F)}\]
- a **mitochondria** is a double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms

## Collecting and using your personal data

### Types of data collected
No.

### Retention of your personal data
I will not retain your personal data only for as long as you want. If you feel like it is necessarry for me to know any of it, feel free to email it to my email adress (`tomas [at] slama [dot] dev`).

### Disclosure of your personal data
I pinky promise not to share the fact that I don't have any of your personal data with anyone. There, I pinky promised, that should suffice in any reasonable court of law.

### Changes to this privacy policy
