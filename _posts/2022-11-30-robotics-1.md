### Robotics Components

{% math ENdefinition "joint" %}connection between multiple links{% endmath %}

{% math ENdefinition "kinematic pair" %}two links in contact such that it limits their relative movement{% endmath %}

- **low-order** kinematic pairs: point of contact is a surface (eg. revolute/prismatic/spherical)
- **high-order** kinematic pairs: point of contact is a dot/line (eg. gears)

{% math ENdefinition "kinematic chain" %}assembly of links connected by joints{% endmath %}
- is a **closed loop** (left image) if every link is connected to every other by at least two paths (including the ground -- imagine it as a single link), else it's **open** (right image)

![Open and closed kinematic chains](/assets/robotics-1/kinematic-chains.svg)

#### Degrees of Freedom
_This is pretty important and will most likely be on the final, so it is best to practice this. Here are [some of the examples from the exercises](/assets/robotics-1/grubler-examples.pdf) with my solutions (sorry for my terrible drawing)._

{% math ENdefinition: "degree of freedom" %}of a mechanical system is the **number of independent parameters** that define its configuration. It can be calculated by the **Grübler Formula**:
{% endmath %}

\[\text{DOF} = \lambda (n - 1) - \sum_{i = 1}^{j} c_i\]

where 
- \(\lambda \ldots\)  DOF of the operating space (\(3\) for 2D, \(6\) for 3D)
	- in 2D it's \(1\) for orientation and \(2\) for position
	- in 3D it's \(3\) for orientation and \(3\) for position
- \(n \ldots\) number of **links**
- \(j \ldots\) number of **kinematic pairs**
	- notice that this is **not the number of joints** -- if a joint includes more kinematics pairs, it needs to be split for the equation to work (see coincident joints below)
- \(c_j \ldots\) degree of constraint of the \(i\)-th kinematic pair
	- eg. a revolute joint in 2D takes away \(2\) DOF (we can only rotate)

For example, the following has \(3 ({\color{red}{4}} - 1) - 2 \cdot {\color{blue}{4}} = 1\) DOF:
![DOF](/assets/robotics-1/dof.svg)

_If you're viewing this in dark theme, the links are colored light blue (red in the equation) and the joints are colored yellow (blue in the equation) -- sorry!_


{% math ENdefinition "coincident joints" %}when there are more than two kinematic pairs in the same joint{% endmath %}

![Coincident joints.](/assets/robotics-1/coincident-joints.svg)

#### Actuators
{% math ENdefinition "actuator" %}a mechanical device for moving or controlling something{% endmath %}

- **DC brushed motor**: based on Lorentz' force law (electromagnetic fields)
	- **brushed** because the metal brush powers the magnets (they're turning)
	- **brushless** uses the position of the motor to turn on/off currents for specific windings
	- usually contains **gears reductions** to trade torque for speed and **sensors** to measure the position of the motor (see further)

![DC motor illustration.](/assets/robotics-1/dc-motor.svg)

- since the voltage controls the motor but setting it to a specific value is impractical, **pulse width modulation (PWM)** is used:

![PWM](/assets/robotics-1/pwm.svg)

- to measure the position of the motor, **optical shaft encoders** (incremental/absolute) are used:

![Incremental and absolute optical encoders.](/assets/robotics-1/optical-encoders.svg)

### Kinematics
- establishment of various coordinate systems to represent the positions and orientations of rigid objects and with transformations among these coordinate systems

![Kinematic spaces.](/assets/robotics-1/kinematic-spaces.svg)

- the dimension of the **configuration space (\(n\))** must be **larger or equal** to the dimension of the **task space (\(m\))** to ensure the existence of kinematic solutions: \[n \ge m\]


#### Forward (direct) Kinematics

{% math ENdefinition "forward/direct kinematics" %}the process of finding the position/orientation of the **end-effector** \((r_1, \ldots, r_m)\) given a set of joint parameters \((q_1, \ldots, q_n)\).{% endmath %}

\[(r_1, \ldots, r_m) = F(q_1, \ldots, q_n)\]

##### Body Pose

The **pose/frame** of a rigid body can be described by its **position** and **orientation** (wrt. a frame)
- the **position** is a vector \(P \in \mathbb{R}^3\)
- the **rotation** is an **orthonormal matrix** \(R \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}\) with \(\det(R) = 1\) (a determinant of \(-1\) would flip the object, we only want rotation)
	- due to orthogonality: \(R^T = R^{-1}\)

\[R = \begin{bmatrix} x' & y' & z' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_x' & y_x' & z_x' \\ x_y' & y_y' & z_y' \\ x_z' & y_z' & z_z' \end{bmatrix}\]

The elementary rotations about each of the axes are the following:

<!---MARKDOWN-->

{:.rightFloatBox}
![Z rotation.](/assets/robotics-1/z-rotation.svg)

<!---PDF
-->

\[
\begin{aligned}
	R_x(\alpha) &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos \alpha & -\sin \alpha \\ 0 & \sin \alpha & \cos \alpha    \end{bmatrix} \\
	R_y(\alpha) &= \begin{bmatrix}  \cos \alpha & 0 & \sin \alpha  \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -\sin \alpha & 0 & \cos \alpha  \end{bmatrix} \\
	R_z(\alpha) &= \begin{bmatrix}  \cos \alpha & -\sin \alpha & 0 \\ \sin \alpha & \cos \alpha & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \\
\end{aligned}
\]

- important to remember for calculating robot kinematics (or just think about what the rotation about an axis is doing to the other two axes, it's not too hard to remember)
- positive values for the rotation are always **counter-clockwise** (just like normal rotations)
- for remembering where the minus is, it's flipped _only for \(y\)_

When discussing multiple frames, we use the following notation:

\[{\scriptstyle \text{to} \atop \scriptstyle\text{from}} R = {\scriptstyle \text{to} \atop \scriptstyle\text{}} R {\scriptstyle \text{} \atop \scriptstyle\text{from}} = R {\scriptstyle \text{to} \atop \scriptstyle\text{from}} \]

E.g. if we have the same point \(p_0, p_1, p_2\) in three different frames, we know that

\[
\begin{aligned}
p_1 &= R^1_2 \cdot p_2 \\
p_0 &= R^0_1 \cdot p_1 \\
p_0 &= R^0_2 \cdot p_2 = R^0_1 \left(R^1_2 \cdot p_2\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

For representing any rotation, we use **Euler's ZYZ angles**, which composes three rotations (Z, Y, Z):

\[
\begin{aligned}
	R &= R_z (\varphi) R_{y'} (\vartheta) R_{z''} (\psi) \\
	&= \begin{bmatrix} c_{\varphi} c_{\vartheta} c_{\psi} - s_{\varphi} s_{\psi} & -c_{\varphi} c_{\vartheta} s_{\psi} - s_{\varphi} c_{\psi} & c_{\varphi} s_{\vartheta} \\ s_{\varphi} c_{\vartheta} c_{\psi} + c_{\varphi} s_{\psi} & -s_{\varphi} c_{\vartheta} s_{\psi} + c_{\varphi} c_{\psi} & s_{\varphi} s_{\vartheta} \\ -s_{\vartheta} c_{\psi} & s_{\vartheta} s_{\psi} & c_{\vartheta} \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\]

For the inverse problem (calculating angles from a matrix of numbers), we can do
\[
\begin{aligned}
	\varphi &= \mathrm{atan}2 (r_{2,3}, r_{1, 3}) \\
	\vartheta &= \mathrm{atan}2 \left(\sqrt{r_{1,3}^2 + r_{2,3}^2}, r_{3, 3}\right) \quad \vartheta \in (0, \pi)\ \text{since we took + sign} \\
	\psi &= \mathrm{atan}2 \left(r_{3,2}, -r_{3,1}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]
- if we divide by zero somewhere we get degenerate solutions where we can only get the sum of the angles (one of the problems with Euler angles)
- alternative is **RPY angles**, which are also three rotations (roll, pitch, yaw) and are just as bad

##### Denavit & Hartenberg Notation
_This is a really important concept and will 99% be on the final, so it is best to practice this. Here is a [useful PDF with examples](/assets/robotics-1/dh-examples.pdf#page=13) (starting at page 13) where you can practice creating the DH tables and Forward Kinematics matrices._

For relating the base and the end effector, we need to both **rotate** and **translate**, so we'll use **homogeneous coordinates** (matrix is \(4 \times 4\)), encoding both rotation and translation:

\[
{\scriptstyle \text{A} \atop \scriptstyle\text{EE}} A = \begin{bmatrix} {\scriptstyle \text{A} \atop \scriptstyle\text{EE}} R & {\scriptstyle \text{A} \atop \scriptstyle\text{EE}} P \\[0.7em] 0\ 0\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
	r_1 & r_2 & r_3 & \Delta x \\
	r_4 & r_5 & r_6 & \Delta y \\
	r_7 & r_8 & r_9 & \Delta z \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To create the homogeneous coordinates in a standardized way, we use the Denavit & Hartenberg (DH) notation which systematically relates the frames of two consecutive links. We have **4 parameters**, each of which relates frame \(i\) to frame \(i - 1\):

| parameter                       | meaning                                                        |
| --:                             | ---                                                            |
| **link length \(a_i\)**         | distance between \(z_i\) and \(z_{i - 1}\) along \(x_i\)       |
| **link offset \(d_i\)**         | distance between \(x_i\) and \(x_{i - 1}\) along \(z_{i - 1}\) |
| **link twist \(\alpha_i\)**     | angle between \(z_i\) and \(z_{i - 1}\) around \(x_i\)         |
| **joint angle \(\vartheta_i\)** | angle between \(x_i\) and \(x_{i - 1}\) around \(z_{i - 1}\)   |

![Denavit & Hartenberg Notation](/assets/robotics-1/dh.svg)

A mnemonic to remember which parameter relates which is that it's **from a to z** (i.e. \(a\) relates \(z\)s).

{:.rightFloatBox}
![Anthropomorphic arm.](/assets/robotics-1/anthropomorphic-arm.svg)

{% math ENexample %} anthropomorphic arm (3 revolute joins):{% endmath %}

|     | \(a_i\) | \(d_i\)     | \(\alpha_i\) | \(\vartheta_i\)   |
| --- | ---     | ---         | ---          | ---               |
| 1   | \(0\)   | \(0\)       | \(\pi / 2\)  | \(\vartheta_1^*\) |
| 2   | \(a_2\) | \(0\)       | \(0\)        | \(\vartheta_2^*\) |
| 3   | \(a_3\) | \(0\)       | \(0\)        | \(\vartheta_3^*\) |

We then get the following transformations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
	A^0_1 (\vartheta_1) &= \begin{bmatrix} c_1 & 0 & s_1 & 0 \\ s_1 & 0 & -c_1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad R = R_z(\vartheta_1) \cdot R_x(\pi / 2) \\
	A^{i-1}_i (\vartheta_1) &= \begin{bmatrix} c_i & -s_i & 0 & a_i c_i \\ s_i & c_i & 0 & a_i s_i \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad i = 2, 3\\
\end{aligned}
\]

To get the final transformations, we can multiply the matrices and get \[T^0_3 (q) = A^0_1 A^1_2 A^2_3\]
This will yield the entire homogeneous matrix -- if we only want position (in this case a homogeneous one with the last element being \(1\)), we can only focus on the last row, which can simplify the computation: \[p^0_3 (q) = A^0_1 A^1_2 A^2_3 \cdot (0, 0, 0, 1)^T\]


Things to keep in mind:
- the \(Z\) axis is always the one we rotate about by \(\vartheta\)
- if the joint is prismatic, \(Z\) axis is instead the one that moves by \(d_i\)
- good idea to fill in the variables first and the rest after

#### Inverse Kinematics
{% math ENdefinition "inverse kinematics" %}the process of finding a set of joint parameters \((q_1, \ldots, q_n)\) given the position/orientation of the **end-effector** \((r_1, \ldots, r_m)\).{% endmath %}

\[(q_1, \ldots, q_n) = G(r_1, \ldots, r_m)\]

{% math ENdefinition "redundancy" %}arises when there are _multiple inverse solutions_{% endmath %}

When dealing with inverse kinematics, an important notion are **workspaces:**
- **primary workspace:** set \(\mathrm{WS}_1\) of positions \(p\) that can be reached with _at least one_ orientation
- **secondary workspace:** set \(\mathrm{WS}_2\) of positions \(p\) that can be reached with _all_ orientations

{: .no-invert}
![Workspaces example.](/assets/robotics-1/workspaces.webp)

##### Analytical solution (closed form)
- preferred (if it can be found)
- use geometric inspection, solve system of equations

{:.rightFloatBox}
![Spherical wrist.](/assets/robotics-1/spherical-wrist.svg)

{% math ENexample %}spherical wrist (3 revolute joins):{% endmath %}

\[T_6^3(q) = \begin{bmatrix} c_4 c_5 c_6 - s_4 s_6 & -c_4 c_5 s_6 - s_4 c_6 & c_4 s_5 & c_4 s_5 d_6 \\ s_4 c_5 c_6 + c_4 s_6 & -s_4 c_5 s_6 + c_4 c_6 & s_4 s_5 & s_4 s_5 d_6 \\ -s_5 c_6 & s_5 s_6 & c_5 & c_5 d_6 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The matrix \(R\) is a ZYZ Euler rotation matrix and can be solved as such (see [Body pose](#body-pose)).
- we use indexes \(3\) to \(6\), because the wrist is usually at an end of another manipulator

{:.rightFloatBox}
![Law of cosines illustration.](/assets/robotics-1/loc.svg)

For solving various manipulators (SCARA, for example), the **law of cosines** might also be quite useful: \[
\begin{aligned}
	c^2 &= a^2 + b^2 - 2\ ab \cos \gamma \\
	a^2 &= b^2 + c^2 - 2\ bc \cos \alpha \\
	b^2 &= a^2 + c^2 - 2\ ac \cos \beta
\end{aligned}\]

{% math ENdefinition "decoupling" %}dividing inverse kinematics problem for two simpler problems, inverse **position** kinematics and inverse **orientation** kinematics{% endmath %}
- is applicable for manipulators with _at least 6 joints_ where the _last 3 intersect at a point_
- the general approach is the following:
	1. calculate the orientations and position where the wrist needs to be
	2. calculate the orientations of the rest of the robot

##### Numerical solution (iterative form)
Two major ways of solving it, namely:

1. **Newton method:**
	- uses Taylor series around point \(q_k\) to expand the forward kinematics \[r = F(q) = F(q_k) + \underbrace{\frac{\partial F(q_k)}{\partial q}}_{\text{Jacobian}\ J(q_k)}(q - q_k) + \underbrace{\mathcal{O}(||q-q_k||^2)}_{\text{neglected}}\]
	- stripping the higher-order terms and solving for \(q\), we get \[\begin{aligned} r &= F(q_k) + J(q_k)(q - q_k) \\ r - F(q_k) &= J(q_k)(q - q_k) \\ J^{-1}(q_k)(r - F(q_k)) &= (q - q_k) \\ q = q_{k + 1} &= q_k + J^{-1}_r(q_k) \underbrace{(r - F(q_k)}_{\text{error}}) \end{aligned} \]
	- is nice when \(n = m\), otherwise we have to use the **[pseudo-inverse](#pseudo-inverse)**
	- bad for problems near singularities (becomes unstable)
	- _note: we're using the Jacobian as a function here but it's just a matrix_

2. **Gradient method:**
	- aims to minimize the squared error (the \(1/2\) is there for nicer calculations): \[H(q) = \frac{1}{2} ||F(q) - r|| = \frac{1}{2} [F(q) - r]^T [F(q) - r]\]
	- the gradient of \(\nabla_q H(q)\) is the steepest direction to minimize this error: \[ \nabla_q H(q) = J(q)^T [F(q) - r] \]
	- to move in this direction (given the current solution), we do the following: \[\begin{aligned} q_{k + 1} &= q_k - \alpha \nabla_q H(q_k) \\           &= q_k - \alpha J(q)^T [F(q) - r] \end{aligned}\]
		- \(\alpha\) should be chosen appropriately (dictates the size of iteration steps)
	- we don't use the inverse but the transpose, which is nice!
	- may not converge but **never diverges**

The methods could also be combined -- gradient first (slow but steady), then Newton.

#### Velocity Kinematics
- relate **linear/angular velocities** \(\dot{p}\) of the end effector to those of the **joints** \(\dot{q}\)
- again determined by the **Jacobian matrix** \(J\) [[nice overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjJgTvnQpBs)]
	- can be obtained either geometrically or by time differentiation
	- depends on the current configuration of the robot (encodes this information)
	- always a \(6 \times n\) matrix:
\[\begin{pmatrix} v_{EE} \\ \omega_{EE} \end{pmatrix} = \dot{p} = J(q)\dot{q} = \begin{pmatrix} J_L(q) \\ J_A(q) \end{pmatrix} \dot{q}\]

Two main cases when calculating the geometric Jacobian are the following:

|                   | **Prismatic Joint \(i\)**                        |                                                                                                |
| \(J_{L_i} (q) \)  | \(z_{i - 1}\)                                    | changes linear velocity (next joint moves linearly)                                            |
| \(J_{A_i} (q) \)  | \(0\)                                            | doesn't change the angular velocity                                                            |
|                   |                                                  |                                                                                                |
|                   | **Angular Joint \(i\)**                          |                                                                                                |
| \(J_{L_i} (q) \)  | \(z_{i - 1} \times p_{i - 1, EE}\) | changes linear velocity too -- moves next link<br>\(p\) is the vector from \(i - 1\) to \(EE\) |
| \(J_{A_i} (q)  \) | \(z_{i - 1} \)                                   | changes angular velocity (next joint rotates linearly)                                         |

Where
- \(z_{i - 1}\) is the orientation of the \(z\) axis in the \((i - 1)\)th frame and
- \(p_{i-1, EE}\) is the distance from the center of the \((i - 1)\)th frame to the end-effector
- \(a \times b\) is the cross product between the vectors \(a, b\), defined like this (_just remember 2-3-1_): \[a \times b = \begin{pmatrix}
	a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2 \\
	a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \\
	a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1
\end{pmatrix}\]

And they can be calculated from the forward kinematics matrix (namely the DH matrices \(A\)):
\[
\begin{aligned}
	z_{i - 1} &= (\overbrace{R^0_1(q_1, \ldots, q_n)}^{\text{rotation part} \atop {\text{of matrix}\ A^0_1} } \cdot \ldots \cdot \overbrace{R^{i-2}_{i-1}(q_1, \ldots, q_n)}^{\text{rotation part} \atop {\text{of matrix}\ A^{i-2}_{i-1}} }) \overbrace{(0, 0, 1)^T}^{\text{just get\ }z} \\
	p_{i - 1, EE} &= \underbrace{p_{0,EE} (q_1, \ldots, q_n)}_{\text{in last column of} \atop {\text{matrix}\ A^0_{EE} } } - \underbrace{p_{0, i - 1}(q_1, \ldots, q_{i - 1}}_{\text{in last column of} \atop {\text{matrix}\ A^{i - 1}_{EE} } })
\end{aligned}
\]

![Planar manipulator illustration.](/assets/robotics-1/planar-manipulator.svg)

{% math ENexample %}planar 2D arm:{% endmath %}

|     | \(a_i\) | \(d_i\) | \(\alpha_i\) | \(\vartheta_i\)         |
| --- | ---     | ---     | ---          | ---                     |
| 1   | \(a_1\) | \(0\)   | \(0\)        | \(\vartheta_1^* = q_1\) |
| 2   | \(a_2\) | \(0\)   | \(0\)        | \(\vartheta_2^* = q_2\) |

\[J = \begin{pmatrix} z_0 \times p_{0,EE} & z_1 \times p_{1, EE} \\ z_0 & z_1 \end{pmatrix}\]

We now calculate \(z\)s and \(p\)s from the DH matrices:

\[A^0_1 = \begin{pmatrix} c_1 & -s_1 & 0 & a_1 c_1 \\ s_1 & c_1 & 0 & a_1 s_1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \quad A^0_2 = \begin{pmatrix} c_{12} & -s_{12}& 0 & a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_{12} \\ s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 & a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_{12} \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\]

We therefore get \[p_{0,1} = (a_1 c_1, a_1 s_1, 0)^T \qquad p_{0, EE} = (a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_{12}, a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_{12}, 0)^T\]

Since \(p_{1,EE} = p_{0,EE} - p_{0,1}\), we get the \(p\)s and, as we see, \(z_0 = z_1 = z_2 = (0, 0, 1)^T\)

The full Jacobian matrix looks like this:
\[J = \begin{pmatrix} z_0 \times p_{0,EE} & z_1 \times p_{1, EE} \\ z_0 & z_1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -a_1 s_1 - a_2 s_{12} & -a_2 s_{12} \\ a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_{12} & a_2 c_{12} \\ 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1\end{pmatrix}\]

The rank of the matrix is between \(1\) and \(2\), depending on the joint configuration.

##### Higher-orders
For calculating other differential relations, we can just continue to derivate:

| Relation     | Equation                                                                                             |
| ---          | ---                                                                                                  |
| velocity     | \(\dot{r} = J_r(q) \dot{q}\)                                                                         |
| acceleration | \(\ddot{r} = J_r(q) \ddot{q} + \dot{J_r}(q) \dot{q}\)                                                |
| jerk         | \(\overset{\ldots}{r} = J_r(q) \overset{\ldots}{q} + \dot{J_r}(q) \ddot{q} + \ddot{J_r}(q) \dot{q}\) |
| snap         | \(\ldots\)                                                                                           |

#### Inverse Velocity Kinematics
- inverse problem to velocity kinematics
- for square non-singular \(J\), we can just do \(\dot{q} = J^{-1} (q) \dot{p}\)
- has problems:
	- \(\dot{q}\) is large near singularities
	- for redundant robots, we don't have an inverse (see [pseudo-inverse](#pseudo-inverse))

##### Singularities

In configurations where the Jacobian loses rank, we're in a **kinematic singularity** -- we cannot find a joint velocity that realizes the desired end-effector velocity in an arbitrary direction of the task space. Close to the singularity, the joint velocities might be very large and exceed the limits.

{: .no-invert}
![Singularity example.](/assets/robotics-1/singularities.webp)

To remedy this, certain methods exist that balance error and velocity to make the robot movement smoother, like **damped least squares**, which minimizes the sum of minimum error norm on _achieved end-effector velocity_ and minimum norm of _joint velocity_.

##### Pseudo-inverse
In the case that there is no solution to \(J\dot{q} = \dot{p}\) (singularities, the robot simply can't move that way, etc.), we still want to find a vector \(\dot{q}\) that minimizes \[|| J \dot{q} - \dot{p} ||\]

This turns out to be the vector \(\dot{q} = J^\# \dot{p}\), where \(J^\#\) is the **pseudo-inverse**:
- can be obtained using SVD and
- satisfies the following conditions:
	1. \(J J^\# J = J\)
	2. \(J^\# J J^\# = J^\#\)
	3. \((J^\# J)^T = J^\# J\)
	4. \((J J^\#)^T = J J^\#\)

#### Force Kinematics
We can again use the Jacobian to relate **forces** of the end effector to those of the joints.

Given \(\tau \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}\) as the vector of infinitesimal joint forces/torques and \(\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 1}\) as the vector of infinitesimal end effector forces/torques. Applying the principle of **virtual work** (the work of the forces applied to the system are zero: (\(dW = dF\ dx = 0\))), we get
\[
\begin{aligned}
	dW_\tau &= \tau^T\ dq \qquad & \text{\# joints} \\
	dW_\gamma &= \gamma^T_e J(q)\ dq \qquad & \text{\# EE} \\
	\forall \delta q \quad \delta W_\tau &= \delta W_\gamma \qquad & \text{\# virtual work}
\end{aligned}\]

Simplifying, we get \[\tau = J^T(q) \gamma\]

This creates **kinetostatic duality** of the Jacobian

{: .no-invert}
![Kinetostatic Duality illustration.](/assets/robotics-1/duality.webp)

As a linear algebra reminder:
- \(\mathrm{rank}(J)\): max number of rows/columns of \(J\) that are linearly independent
	- \(\mathrm{rank(J)} \le \min(m, n)\) 
	- _if the rank of \(J\) is full (typically \(m\)), then the robot's EE can move in any direction; if not, there exists a direction in which the robot cannot move_
- \(\mathrm{range}(J)\): vector subspace generated by all possible linear combinations of columns of \(J\)
	- i.e. is a set of all possible values of where \(J\) can map vectors
	- _determines the velocities that EE can reach based on velocities of joints_
- \(\mathrm{kernel}(J)\): vector subspace generated by all vectors \(v\) such that \(Jv = \mathbf{0}\)
	- i.e. is a set of all possible values of where \(J\) maps to the vector \(\mathbf{0}\)
	- _is the set of joint velocities that produce no EE velocity_

**Note that the problems are switched:** compare the two equations \[\overbrace{\dot{p} = J(q)\dot{q}}^{\text{velocity kinematics}} \qquad \overbrace{\tau = J^T(q) \gamma}^{\text{(inverse) force kinematics}}\]
- for velocities, it is trivial to calculate the **end-effector velocity** from **joint velocities**
- for torques, it is trivial to calculate the **joint torques** from the **end-effector torques**

For completeness, here are some properties of the Jacobian and its transpose:
\[\begin{aligned}
	\mathrm{range}(J) &= \left\{\dot{p} \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid \exists \dot{q} \in \mathbb{R}^n, J \dot{q} = \dot{p}\right\} \\
	\mathrm{range}(J^T) &= \left\{\tau \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \exists \gamma \in \mathbb{R}^m, \tau = J^T \gamma \right\} \\[0.5em]
	\mathrm{kernel}(J) &= \left\{\dot{q} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid J \dot{q} = \mathbf{0}\right\} \\
	\mathrm{kernel}(J^T) &= \left\{\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid J^T \gamma = \mathbf{0}\right\} \\[0.5em]
	\mathrm{range}(J) + \mathrm{kernel}(J^T) &= \mathbb{R}^m \\
	\mathrm{range}(J^T) + \mathrm{kernel}(J) &= \mathbb{R}^n
\end{aligned}
\]

### Trajectory Planning
**Task:** generate reference inputs to the controller when given:
1. only start and end defined (minimum requirements)
2. sequence of points defined (more difficult)

{% math ENdefinition "path" %}set of points in the joint space which the manipulator has to follow in the execution of the assigned motion (purely geometric).{% endmath %}

{% math ENdefinition "trajectory" %}a path on which a timing is specified (velocities, accelerations, etc.).{% endmath %}
- i.e. **trajectory = geometric path + time law**
- notation is \(q = q(\lambda) \rightarrow \lambda = \lambda(t)\)

To plan the **trajectory**, we do the following:
1. get the sequence of pose points (i.e. **knots**) in the _Cartesian space_
2. create a geometric path linking the knots (interpolation)
3. sample the path and transform the sequence to the _Joint space_
4. interpolate in the Joint space

{: .no-invert}
![Trajectory Planning example.](/assets/robotics-1/tp.webp)

We do this because planning in the Cartesian space can easily move the robot into configurations that can't be realized, which isn't the case for the Joint space.

The **time law** is chosen based on task specification:
- stop at a point, move at constant velocity
- considers constraints and capabilities (max velocity, accelerations)
- may attempt to optimize some metric (min transfer time, min energy, etc.)

#### In Joint Space
**Task:** smoothly interpolate between points in the joint space

##### Cubic polynomial
Useful for interpolating between two positions (\(q_0, q_1\)) given the start and end velocity (\(v_0, v_1\)):
\[q(0) = q_0 \quad q(1) = q_1 \quad q'(0) = v_0 \quad q'(1) = v_1\]

The cubic polynomial in the normalized form is the following: \[q(\lambda) = q_0 + \nabla q[a \lambda^3 + b \lambda^2 + c \lambda + d] \qquad \text{for}\ \nabla q = q_1 - q_0; \lambda \in \left[0, 1\right]\]

Plugging for known values helps us solve the polynomial:
- \(q(0) = q_0 \Rightarrow d = 0\)
- \(q'(0) = \nabla q \cdot c \Rightarrow c = v_0 / \nabla q\)
- \(q(1) = q_1 \Rightarrow a + b + c = 1\)
- \(q'(1) = \nabla q \cdot (3a + 2b + c) \Rightarrow 3a + 2b + c = v_1 / \nabla q\)

If we don't care about normalization, the general form is the following: \[q(\lambda) = a \lambda^3 + b \lambda^2 + c \lambda + d\]

##### Splines
When we have \(N\) knots and want continuity up to the second derivative, we can **concatenate \(N - 1\) cubic polynomials**, which minimizes the curvature among all interpolating functions (with \(2\)nd derivatives)
- \(4(N - 1)\) coefficients
- \(4(N - 1) - 2\) conditions:
	- \(2(N - 1)\) for the positions of the knots
	- \(2(N - 2)\) for the continuity for first and second derivative at the internal knots
	- \(\Rightarrow\) we have \(2\) free parameters for assigning \(v_1, v_N\)

#### In Cartesian Space
_Notation here is \(p = p(s) \rightarrow s = s(t)\) (as opposed to \(q = q(\lambda) \rightarrow \lambda = \lambda(t)\)), since we're planning the position of the end-effector, not the position in the joint space._

Has advantages and disadvantages:
- **[+]** allows more direct visualization of the generated path
- **[+]** can account for obstacles + lack of "wandering"
- **[-]** needs on-line kinematic inversion

When calculating the path:
- for simplicity, **position** and **orientation** are considered separately
- the number of knots is typically low (2 or 3), simple interpolating paths are considered

##### Position
Given \(p_i, p_f, v_{\mathrm{max}}, a_{\mathrm{max}}\) and \(v_{\mathrm{i}}, v_{\mathrm{f}} \) (usually \(0\)), we want to analyze the trajectory.

For a **linear** path from \(p_i\) to \(p_f\):
- path parametrization is \(p(s) = p_i + s(p_f - p_i)\) with \(s \in \left[0, 1\right]\)
	- setting \(s = \sigma / L, \sigma \in \left[0, L\right] \) (given the length of the path)
- we can differentiate to get velocity and acceleration: \[\begin{aligned}
	\dot{p} &= \frac{dp}{ds}\dot{s} &= (p_f - p_i) \dot{s} = \frac{p_f - p_i}{L} \dot{\sigma} \\
	\ddot{p} &= \frac{d^2s}{ds^2} \dot{s}^2 + \frac{dp}{ds}\ddot{s} &= (p_f - p_i) \ddot{s} = \frac{p_f - p_i}{L} \ddot{\sigma} \\
\end{aligned}\]

For the motion, we use the **trapezoidal speed** (bang-coast-bang):

{: .no-invert}
![Bang-coast-bang analysis illustration.](/assets/robotics-1/trapezoid.webp)

To generalize this (i.e. concatenate the paths), we can **over-fly** the point in between.
A specific example of how this would look like is the following:

{: .no-invert}
![Fly-over analysis illustration.](/assets/robotics-1/fly-over.webp)

##### Orientation
1. use **minimal representations** (e.g. ZYZ Euler angles) and plan the trajectory independently
2. use **axis/angle representation**:
	- determine a neutral axis and an angle by which to rotate
	- plan a timing law to interpolate the angle and the axis

##### Optimal trajectories
For **Cartesian robots** (PPP):
1. straight line joining the two positions is one of those
	- can be executed in minimum time under velocity-acceleration constraints
2. optimal timing law is the bang-coast-bang

For **articulated robots** (at least one R):
- 1. and 2. are no longer true in general case, but time-optimality still holds in the _joint space_
	- note that straight lines in joint space don't correspond to those in Cartesian space!

##### Uniform time scaling
Say we want to slow a given timing law down or speed it up because of constraints, we don't need to recalculate all of the motion profiles: velocity scales **linearly**, acceleration scales **quadratically**:
\[
\begin{aligned}
dp/dt &= dp/ds \cdot ds/d\tau \cdot {\color{red}{1/T}} \\
d^2p/dt^2 &= (d^2p/ds^2 \cdot (ds/d\tau)^2 + dp/ds \cdot d^2s/d\tau^2) \cdot {\color{red}{1/T^2}}
\end{aligned}\]

**Example (max relative violations)** with \(T = 1 [\mathrm{s}]\):
- \(k_{\text{vel}} = \max \left\{1, |\dot{q}_1| / v_{\max,1}, |\dot{q}_2| / v_{\max,2}\right\}\)
- \(k_{\text{acc}} = \max \left\{1, |\ddot{q}_1| / a_{\max,1}, |\ddot{q}_2| / a_{\max,2}\right\}\)

Minimum uniform time scaling is therefore \[k = \max \left\{1, k_{\text{vel}}, \sqrt{k_{\text{acc}}}\right\}\]


#### Manipulability

##### Velocity manipulability
In a given configuration, we want to evaluate how „effective“ is the mechanical transformation between joint velocities and EE velocities (how „easily“ can EE move in various directions of the task space).
- we consider all EE velocities that can be obtained by choosing joint velocities of **unit norm**:

\[\dot{q}^T \dot{q} = \underbrace{v^T J^{\#T}J^\#v}_{\text{ellipsoid}} = 1\]

{: .no-invert}
![Velocity and force manipulability.](/assets/robotics-1/manipulability.webp)

##### Force manipulability
We can apply the exact same concept to forces:

\[\tau^T \tau = \underbrace{F^TJJ^{T}F}_{\text{ellipsoid}} = 1\]

The comparison between the two is interesting -- they are **orthogonal** (velocity left; force right):

{: .no-invert}
![Cubic spline illustration](/assets/robotics-1/force-vector-manipulability-comparison.webp)

The explanation that the teacher gave in class is pretty good: if your arm is almost stretched, it can move very quickly up and down but not too quickly forward/backward. On the other hand (pun not intended), the forces you can apply up/down are not nearly as large as when pushing/pulling.
