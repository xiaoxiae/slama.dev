{% photos austria-2023/raw/s2.png&<strong>Summit attempt 1:</strong> almost made it, but the conditions were terrible â€“ the last ~4 hours were a field of rocks covered by snow, each of which was extremely slippery. We gave up around 2 hours before the summit and went back.  %}

<figcaption><strong>Summit attempt 2:</strong> success! The conditions were amazing and, even despite those, the top was extremely sketchy (last 30 minutes were essentially soft climbing on snow). We made it back in like 3 hours of running, which was pretty exciting and a completely different mood to the first attempt.</figcaption>
