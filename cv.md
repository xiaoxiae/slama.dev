This section of the personal website is dedicated to my curriculum vitae. For additional information, feel free to contact me at `tomas [at] slama [dot] dev`, and to browse through my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/).

Also, there is an up-to-date [PDF version](/cv.pdf) (neatly typeset in \(\TeX\)), if you're interested.
