In this addition to my Manim series, we'll cover the (at the moment rather experimental) OpenGL backend for faster GPU-based rendering.

It is **heavily** based on [aquabeam's article](https://www.aquabeam.me/manim/opengl_guide/) and [Benjamin Hackl's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXBLPC1tns) (criminally underrated, by the way) about ManimCommunity's OpenGL support.
