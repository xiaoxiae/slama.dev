    note: I had my second Covid shot on Friday and was out for the entire weekend, so it was surprising that I managed to do the yellow one and make progress on a few blue ones!

    note: Today was a pretty tired day, considering the climbing I did yesterday. At least I finished the blue one I made progress on yesterday and tried a few new yellow ones to do.

    note: First session with new shoes (Skwamas). The yellow was surprisingly not bad. Also, I made progress on two other yellows that seem pretty difficult, but will probably go after a few attempts.

    note: The entire session was spent on the last two yellows from previous setting that I haven't yet done. The first one went after about 20 tries and I managed to make all individual moves on the second one, so today was quite a success!

    yellow:
      old: 1
    note: Today was not good. I felt tired, but at least still managed to do the crimpy salmon that I struggled with. Also, I made many more tries on the last yellow one in the pool, but no dice -- at least I got the beta down!.

    note: Today was worse. I felt much more tired and wrongly assumed that there will be new boulders today, which there weren't. I made some good attempts on the last yellow on the pool and the hard blue in the ball, at least.

    note: Although I took a break for more than 10 days and it definitely feels like it, I found a very nice beta for the new yellow that I sent, which is super nice. I also did two new blues and filmed some salmons that I missed last session (because my battery died).

    note: The new boulders feel harder than the previous batch (namely the yellows). I still feel a bit sick (had sore throat and fever 2 days ago), but I still managed to do some salmons, blues and even a yellow. Next time should feel much better.

    note: The two easier yellows from the new boulders went down, along with the last blue (super nice coordination move, weird end) and the last salmon too. I also managed to repeat the yellow one that I haven't filmed yet. Now to start projecting the other yellows, which are just brutal...

    note: In the new rebuild, all of the blues (besides one) feel very easy, same as the salmon ones (again, besides one). However, the yellows feel completely impossible. I'll try to finish the two easy blues that I haven't done next session, and will begin working on the yellows after that.

  '2021-10-26':
    wall: BigWall
    note: I started doing sport climbing! This session was spent at Big Wall and was bad, because I'm not very good at sport climbing. I'll still try to do a sports climbing session once in a while to improve my endurance, which at this point is quite lacking.
  '2021-10-28':
    note: Second sport climbing session, this time at Smíchoff. I did some 7's and an onsight of 8, which I'm pretty happy about. I then finished up with some bouldering, getting closer to climbing the new yellows.
  '2021-10-30':
    note: I projected the yellow in the 45 (almost got the top sequence done) and the one on the island (literally fell while matching the top hold). I'm very confident in finishing the one on the island next session, and linking the one in 45.

    note: The new routes all seem pretty easy. I'm honestly not sure whether I'm getting stronger or the climbs are getting easier. Of the three remaining yellows, I think the jumpy and the traverse one will go, but the volumy one seems completely impossible.

    note: There was a rebuild on Monday and a boulder challenge today. It went surprisingly well -- I climbed all of the new boulders that were easier than yellows (which I'm very happy about, since my endurance is quite poor), and three of the new yellows, ending in the 2nd place, only a few points after the insanely strong Lukáš Mokroluský. There are two other hard yellows that I think I can finish next session, and a new long-term project yellow.

    note: A little better than the previous one. I managed to climb one of the yellows from the last setting with an alternative beta -- the send attempt looked a bit sketchy, but it felt much more stable than jumping.

    wall: Boulder Bar
    note: Went to Boulder bar with a few friends. It was a pretty nice change, but I'm eager to go back to Smíchoff soon. Coincidentally, Adam Ondra was just visiting Prague and was at the boulder bar. It was very humbling and inspiring seeing him flash all my red projects... still a long way to go.

    note: Decent session. Managed to get all new salmons and almost all blues (one is quite hard). Also, one of the remaining yellows will definitely go. This, however, cannot be said for the last red that I haven't yet done, since it's as hard as a blue.

    note: Climbed more than I thought I would! I finished all of the new yellows, so only one blue remains (I finished the tough red too). Besides this, I managed to do the salmon double dyno from the set before this one, which was a nice surprise.

    note: The new climbs are all quite easy (like a grade easier than they should be) -- most videos are flash attempts. However, the remaining two yellows will be a bit tough -- one should go down next session, but the other seems quite impossible (when Danny says it's hard, it's likely impossible).

I did manage to link the yellow in the overhang, which was a bit surprising, but linking it will be tough and, since they're taking it down in a few days, likely undoable.

I also forgot the tripod, so I'll have to record them next time -- however, I just found out that the smaller tripod that I got with the camera will actually be much better for recording, as it is much more compact and probably stable enough.

    note: Went to Mandala in Dresen today and it was absolutely great! There was a competition yesterday so I had a chance of trying both the qualification and the finals boulders -- they were tough but I did manage to get 80/100 on one of the final ones (not trying the other two for too long), which I'm quite proud of.

    note: The blue in the 45 was modified so I'm counting it as a new climb, since it got harder. Besides this, I managed to send the two remaining salmons on my first attempt and am now trying to piece together the yellows. I think that one of them will go (likely the one in the 45), while the other will be a bit too difficult for me. I also climbed the comp-style boulder in the back, which was fun!

I made progress on some of the yellows that I haven't done, but they will be tough.

I'm a little sad about the format change, since it was enough to only climb the most of the hardest difficulty and nothing else, meaning that I only climbed 4 difficult boulders.

    note: A pretty fun session (mostly training). The Kilter Board is absolutely amazing and I think this is where I'll be spending most of my time, since the routes itself aren't all that interesting.

    note: I sent two new blacks and fell from the top of a third one so today was a pretty good day! I also met a few new friends that also sends hard boulders so I think I'll be mostly going in the evenings. It is a bit more crowded but being able to climb with good climbers is a worthy trade-off.

    note: I sent the black that I fell from the top of, along with some neat new reds. I also managed to figure out the beta of one really hard black that I'll work on next time, it felt absolutely amazing to link it all together and it definitely feels doable on a strong day.

    note: Despite feeling pretty good, I didn't manage do send the black from the previous session, although falling twice from the top :(. That was a bit upsetting so I spent the rest of the session Kilter boarding, which was fun (not a lot of hard sends but some fun moves)! I'll try to do a proper Kilter board session in a few days.

    note: The new set was pretty neat! There are still two remaining reds that I think will go down in the next session, but we'll see -- my first priority is the black. It will actually probably be the next session over, because I'd like to focus a bit more on Kilter boarding.

    note: A fun Kilter board session. I did the first 7b and a bunch of 7a/7a+, which was nice. I also made individual moves on a 7c which I think I'll do next time. It's nice to see some progress from the previous session!

    note: Good session! I finished the 7b from the previous session but the 7c will be a bit more difficult (the top is unexpectedly hard), so I might need to find a different one to train for. Also, one of the new reds will go next time with a sneaky beta I found.

    note: New routes were pretty fun! There was one easy dyno, some harder crimpy stuff and one coordination move. I also managed to do the hard black from a few sessions ago! After doing the easiest black of the new ones, I don't think that I want to try the other two because one hurts my fingers and the other is insane!

    note: A very nice Kilter board session! Sent some nice 7as, 7a+s and a 7b (that I had absolutely no chance at a few sessions ago) relatively easily, with really good attempts on some other difficult routes that should hopefully go down next session!

    note: Another pretty good session. The goal of doing a 7c seems to be quite a bit more difficult since the jump between 7b and 7c is quite large. Nevertheless, I tried a few 7cs and 7c+s and I think that some will go down in a few sessions.

    note: There were new boulders on the island. The blues were pretty hard and a few of the red ones also (still missing one). There are two new blacks, one of which is very endurancey (so I don't think I can send it), but the other is very powerful and I've done all the individual moves, so it should go next time.

    note: Pretty decent session. I did the new reds (along with some from the hangar that I haven't been to yet) and the black that I mentioned two sessions ago. I figured out a totally different beta though so it was like climbing a totally new route (will hopefully get it on video next time). Also messed around a bit with some fun custom routes (see video).

    note: Fun session! The new black went down with quite a neat beta and I managed to send the red in the roof while also making good progress on the other red in the roof (which is more like black).

    note: A very long but fun session. I did all of the new routes (besides the red in the roof which I'll do next time when I'm fresh) and then messed around on a bunch of custom problems. I also helped with setting of today's christmas boulder problem, which I think turned out very well :).

    note: The new blacks are insanely hard, which is nice -- there's something to do :). I did two of them in two parts and I know that I can send both, but the third one is quite long and it has a paddle move at the end (which will is hard to do even in isolation), so I'm not sure about that one.

    note: Did the routes from Saturday and those outside, only the hangar remains. It's getting warmer outside so climbing isn't too bad, will give them a go next time :).
  '2023-03-04':
    note: A really fun session at Smíchoff! The routes felt pretty hard and I'm not sure if they got harder or I got weaker. Ah well...

    note: Took a very long break, during which I was climbing only sporadically. I've been feeling pretty good again recently (mostly due to the break), so, with the start of the next semester, I plan on starting to record my climbs and also add training days to the journal too.

    note:
    - Worst session in months. This note will be a bit longer.
    - First off, I managed to somehow **pull a muscle while warming up** (and by warming up I mean climbing a few 'easier' routes), which is really fucking stupid and should not happen. **I need to warm up better** to prevent things like this from happening.</p><p class='climbing-note'>Second (but kind of tied to first), the warm up was **nowhere long enough** to get properly warm before trying the routes, resulting in really bad first attempts on harder routes that went completely to waste.
    - Third, the attempts on the hard routes were done **without breaks in between,** which I often do, but not to this extent -- throwing yourself at a route does not help and is, again, **fucking stupid.**
    - These three things resulted in a completely wasted session.
    - 'From now on, things will change. No warmup blues. No 5 seconds of brushing between ground attempts. I will, instead, be doing the following:'
    - <ul><li class='climbing-note'>**At least 15 minutes of warm-up** -- maybe not ideal, but a start.</li><li class='climbing-note'>**At least 3 minute break between attempts**, which is around 100x more than now.</li></ul>
    - If not, I will find you Tom. I know where you live.

Not sure how to go about preventing this, but I should probably climb more mindfully instead of 'power go brrr'.
